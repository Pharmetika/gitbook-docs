# ION Task Queue

Users can refine their view by selecting specific tasks from the dropdown menu and searching for a provider or patient to locate a prescription. They can also filter tasks by status—overdue, due, upcoming, or complete—by clicking the corresponding buttons. The task queue will then display all tasks matching the selected filters, organized chronologically from oldest to newest.
