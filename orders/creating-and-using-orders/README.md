## Creating Orders

You can create an order by navigating to a patient's summary, and clicking **Create Order** in the patient's order list.

On the new order screen, you will have a list containing the patient you created the order, an empty list of order items, and order information including the shipping address, delivery method, the date the order is needed by, priority, and order notes.

You can add more patients the order by searching for and selecting them in the patients section. Once you've added any additional patients to the order, you can start searching for Rxs to add in the **Add Item** field.

Once you've added all items to the order, and selected a handoff method and ready by date, you can click **Submit** to save the order.

## Adding a Prescription in Ready Status to an Order

Prescriptions with a “Ready” status can be added to an order by scanning the transaction ID on the prescription label. After scanning, the patient and prescription details will appear on the screen within a few seconds. This feature is useful for pharmacies that want to quickly add ready prescriptions to an order for shipping and invoicing.

* Use the transaction ID barcode on the prescription label.

## Filling Orders

To fill items in an order you should find the order either on the order list on a patient summary, or on the new/in-progress order lists.

Once you've found the order you want to fill items for, use the arrow on the left side to expand the order. Once the order is expanded, you'll see fill buttons for each item that has not yet been filled. When you click this button to fill an item, the quantity, handoff method, notes, ready-by date, and priority will be automatically filled with what was selected for the order.

Once you fill an item that will update the order to indicate that item has been filled.
