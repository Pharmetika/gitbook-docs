# Order Fulfillment

Orders can be fulfilled either through the standard prescription hand-off page, or from the order fulfillment page.

Fulfilling an order from the order fulfillment page will function similarly to order reconciliation. You will select the order, scan each item, and then you will be prompted to create a shipment for shipped orders, or the order items will be marked as picked-up for pick-up orders.

When fulfilling orders from the prescription handoff screen you will need to find the order items and select them. You can adjust the order filtering to make this easier.

If you only select some but not all of the order items, a warning will be displayed when you try to create a shipment.

Once all order items are selected you can create the shipment as usual.
