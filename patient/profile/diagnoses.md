# Diagnoses

## Add/edit a Condition

In this section, pharmacies can record diagnoses. These conditions will be documented as patient-level diagnoses, helping pharmacists understand the overall health profile of the patient. This is separate from the prescription-level diagnosis selected during prescription entry.

To add a diagnosis, click on the **Add** button to open the Diagnosis form, search the condition, complete the other necessary fields, and click **Save**.

## Manage a Condition

To update the diagnosis based on new information, click the pencil icon ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-24 at 10.13.17 AM.png>) to open the form. From there, you can make the necessary edits and add notes to reflect the latest details. This allows you to ensure that the patient's information are always current and accurate.

The "Updated By" field will display the "Pharmacy" and the name of the last pharmacy staff member who updated the information. **Note:** Previous editors will not be saved or displayed.

## No Known Diagnoses (NKDx)

For no known diagnoses, click on the NKDx button, which will autofill the necessary fields: code, diagnosis description, clinical status, and severity. Changes can be made if new information becomes available by clicking the pencil icon ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-24 at 10.13.17 AM (1).png>).
