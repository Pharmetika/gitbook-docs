Patient will click on the link to open up a web browser site. Then click on **Add Payment Method**. Patients can toggle on/off if the card is a FSA/HSA, and if they want the card to be their primary payment option.

Once the patient has added the payment method, the pharmacy will receive a task called **Payment Method Update**.

The task will show the patient’s name, a link to the patient’s profile, and any outstanding transactions. Click **Mark Complete** as an acknowledgement the patient has added a payment to their profile.
