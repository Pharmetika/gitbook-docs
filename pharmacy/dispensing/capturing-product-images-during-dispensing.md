# Capturing Product Images During Dispensing

Pharmacies can now capture an image of the final product and/or quantity for each prescription dispensed. This will assist with quality control and the image will be available for viewing in the event of a patient complaint. The “Take Photo” button will appear after the product lot label is scanned. This feature is compatible with any camera, whether it's on a desktop, laptop, iPad, or other device.

After capturing the image, it will be attached to the dispense and saved under 'Documents' on the left and can be easily accessed in the Dispense Queue when needed.
