# Partial Fills

To dispense and mail out a partial fill, you should first record the partial fill in your dispensing queue.

You should then set the "Date Ready By" to a future date (when you expect to finish dispensing).

You can then go the patient's summary, and under the **Shipments** panel, there will be an option to create a custom shipment.

Here you can select a handoff method and click **Create** to make a shipping label for your partial fill.

Once you're ready to dispense the rest of the fill, you can dispense and finish the fill as usual (verify it and create a shipment from the prescription hand-off screen).
