# Shipments

Shows all prescriptions that have a shipping label created that is ready to ship or has been shipped out. Users can filter by searching in the 'Filter Shipments' bar for a specific patient or tracking number or use date ranges. Users can also view shipping manifests, reprint shipping labels, and track and void labels on this screen.
