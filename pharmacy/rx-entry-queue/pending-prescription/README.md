# Pending Prescription

Pending Prescription allows the user to put a prescription on hold in the patientâ€™s profile without attaching a prescription number.

* **Profile Only:** By selecting this option, the user profiles the prescription. This means that it doesn't require PV1 processing until the prescription is filled.
* **Fill Upon Verification:** When this option is chosen, the prescription is automatically queued for dispensing as soon as it undergoes PV1 verification.
