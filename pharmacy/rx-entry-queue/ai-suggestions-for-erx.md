# AI Suggestions for eRx

Incoming electronic prescriptions (eRxs) from the Provider Portal and Surescripts will now have AI suggestions for commonly selected directions and products based on the eRx data.

The product and direction most likely to be selected from the eRx will automatically be pushed into the prescription entry fields when the pharmacy user clicks “New” button.

The AI suggestion feature is presented by a wizard hat icon, this can be found on the top right corner of the direction box. This icon appears after the prescription information has been transferred into the prescription entry fields from the eRx. If there are multiple potential products and/or directions, they can be seen and selected by clicking on the icon.

The currently selected direction and product will have a green checkmark next to them.
