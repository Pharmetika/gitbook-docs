# Transferring Prescriptions on the Data Verification Page

Pharmacies can transfer a prescription directly from the Verification page (PV1) to streamline workflow and improve efficiency. This feature works the same as the transfer option on the Patient Summary page but is located within the Verification page, simplifying the process. When this option is selected other options listed such as “Profiled Only” or “Fill Upon Verification” will be disabled.

### The prescription can be transferred to either:

1. Another pharmacy using the Pharmatika system, or
2. An external pharmacy.

### Follow the steps below to transfer a prescription to either option.

1. Mark the "Transfer Upon Verification" checkbox.

3. Transferring to another **realm** will not require any pharmacy information to be filled out. For **external pharmacy** transfers, fill out the form and click **Save.**
