# System Configurations

The system configurations within ION are customized to align with each pharmacy's preferences and are applied uniformly to all system users. These settings affect multiple areas of the system, including the display of pharmacy information on labels and receipts, templates used for communication with patients and prescribers, and the addition of contact email addresses for receiving system notifications. This centralized approach streamlines pharmacy operations and ensures a consistent, efficient experience for the pharmacy team.
