# State Settings

The system is designed to accommodate the regulatory requirements of all 50 states, ensuring compliance and operational efficiency. Key features include state-specific settings that restrict shipping to states where the pharmacy is licensed or permitted to ship to. Additionally, the system enforces product-specific restrictions based on state requirements, preventing the filling or shipment of certain items in states where they are not authorized.
