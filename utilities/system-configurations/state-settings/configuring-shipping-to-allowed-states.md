# Configuring Shipping to Allowed States

If “[restrict shipping to allowed states](../restrictions.md)” is selected, the pharmacy will need to select the states they are licensed to ship to in the State Settings. Select all the states the pharmacy is actively licensed in and authorized to fill and ship prescriptions to.&#x20;

All 50 states will have the option to select Licensed/Allow. Once a state is selected as licensed/allow, prescriptions can be filled and shipped to that state based on the primary address on the patient's profile.&#x20;

* If multiple addresses are on a patient profile, the Primary Address is what will be used as the shipping address unless an Address Date Selection is set for an alternate address on the patient profile.
* If the pharmacy is not licensed to ship to a state and the state is not selected in the state settings, a pop-up alert will be displayed when attempting to fill and ship prescriptions.&#x20;
  * The user will be allowed to type and verify a prescription to a non-licensed state through prescription entry. However, when attempting to fill the prescription, a pop-up alert will appear, warning them of the issue. They will still have the option to proceed by overriding the alert to complete the prescription filling.

* The user will be allowed to dispense and verify a prescription to a non-licensed state through the dispensing queue. However, when attempting to create a shipment, a pop-up alert will appear, enforcing a hard stop. This means the user will be unable to generate a shipping label until the issue is addressed.
