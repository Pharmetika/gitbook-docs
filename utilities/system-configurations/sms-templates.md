# SMS Templates

Patient SMS templates are an efficient tool for standardizing text message communications with patients directly from their profiles. These templates enable clear and concise messaging for purposes such as appointment reminders, prescription notifications, or other important updates.

The system includes preloaded SMS templates that can be used as-is or tailored to fit the specific needs of the pharmacy or healthcare practice. Customizing these templates allows for more personalized and relevant communication while maintaining professionalism. Utilizing SMS templates improves efficiency, reduces manual effort, and ensures consistent, timely engagement with patients.
