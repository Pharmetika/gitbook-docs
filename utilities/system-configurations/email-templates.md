# Email Templates

Patient email templates are a practical tool designed to simplify and standardize communication with patients via email. These templates ensure clear, professional, and consistent messaging for various purposes, such as prescription updates, or reminders.

The system includes preloaded email templates that can be used as-is or customized to meet the specific needs of the pharmacy. By modifying these templates, pharmacies can personalize messages to align with their branding and address patient-specific concerns. Utilizing these templates enhances efficiency, reduces the risk of errors, and promotes effective patient engagement and satisfaction.
