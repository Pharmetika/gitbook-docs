# Pharmacy Contact Information

The pharmacy has the ability to assign user email addresses to receive updates with information tailored to the set contact types. These email addresses can be updated at any time.

* To add an email address, click the (+) sign next to the contact type, enter the email address into the empty field, click the (+) sign a second time or hit enter and the email will display under the associated contact type. Once all the emails have been added to the contact types, click Save at the top of the System Configurations.&#x20;
* If one user is the primary contact for all communication, assign the user’s email address to all contact types. Multiple email addresses can be assigned to each contact type if more than one user chooses to receive updates.&#x20;
