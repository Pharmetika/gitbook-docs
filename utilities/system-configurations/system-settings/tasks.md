### Disable Task Categories

If the pharmacy chooses to hide tasks from the dashboard, they may select to disable tasks categories. The intention of disabling task categories is to streamline the task filter type that the pharmacy is not using. Disabling these task categories will remove them from being visible on the dashboard.

Options to disable:  Case Management, Clinical, Communications, Information Update, Patient, Prescriber, Prescription, Refills, Shipment, Workflow.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Disabling these tasks may lead to hiding important tasks or information. Ensure that the pharmacy understands the use of all tasks before disabling.
