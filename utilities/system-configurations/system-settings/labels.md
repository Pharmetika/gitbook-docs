### Always include corporate name on patient label

This setting will display the corporate name on the patient label created in the dispensing queue.

Some states require the corporate name either in addition or instead of the business name. To only include the corporate name, select to always include corporate name on patient label and ensure that “Include business name on patient label” is not selected. To include the corporate and business name on the patient label, select both.&#x20;

### Hide patient address

Removes patient address from the prescription label created in the dispensing queue.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Useful for 503B pharmacies or when shipping to the clinic. This setting applies to all patient prescription labels generated in the dispensing queue.
{% endhint %}

### Hide monograph QR code on prescription label

The QR code will appear if a custom Monograph Link is linked to the product in ION or ElectricLab. If the setting to hide the monograph is selected, the QR code will no longer be visible on any prescription label. This setting is not product-specific, meaning that when it is disabled, QR codes for monographs will not appear on any prescription labels.

### Use CA strict label for California patients&#x20;

Select Yes or No &#x20;

For California, there are prescription requirements that are not enforced in other states. Select YES if the pharmacy is licensed to ship to California. When dispensing a prescription for a patient with a primary address in California, the CA strict label will print during dispensing.&#x20;
