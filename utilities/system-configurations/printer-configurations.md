# Printer Configurations

If the pharmacy would like to set up network printing for automatic printing, a transmitter must be used to configure this set up. The default printer server device ID will need to be initially set up which will then be automatically selected when adding a new printer. This is the device id of the transmitter that will be handling print jobs.
