# Splitting Charges Between Multiple Payment Sources

In some cases, patients might want to pay for their prescriptions using multiple payment sources. For example, a patient who owes $53 for a prescription might want to charge half of the payment to one credit card and the other half to a different credit card. There are several ways to split a payment between multiple sources, depending on how you reconcile charges for accounting purposes.

## Option 1

1. In the **Unbilled Items** section, find the item you want to charge.
2.  Enter the amount you want to charge to the first payment source in the **Due** field.&#x20;

4.  Manually add a second charge to the **Unbilled Items** section for the remaining balance. Make sure to record the prescription number and indicate that this is a split payment.&#x20;

1.  In the **Unbilled Items** section, manually add two charges, one for each payment method. Make sure to record the prescription number and indicate that this is a split payment.&#x20;
