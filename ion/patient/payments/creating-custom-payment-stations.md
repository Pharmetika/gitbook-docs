# Creating Custom Payment Stations

Pharmacies with multiple payment stations can create configurable payment system options for invoices. This ensures consistency across all payment stations, replacing free-text entries, and facilitates easier designation and better communication for pharmacy technicians when they mark payments as paid to the cashier.

## Configuring Multiple Payment Stations

Find the Payment section in System Configuration > System Settings

In the 'Default Payment Method Options' field, enter the name of a payment station and click the circle Add button, and click the blue **Save** button for system setting. Repeat these steps to add more stations.

These payment stations can be selected for invoices to be marked as paid using methods other than credit cards.
