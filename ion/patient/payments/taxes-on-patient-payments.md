# Taxes on Patient Payments

Patient charges may be taxable if any of the following apply:

* The patient is non-human.
* The product has been marked as OTC in the product manager.
* The product has been marked as taxable in the product manager.

If a charge is taxable, and a state tax has been configured for the state the patient resides in, the tax will be displayed below the unbilled items table.

The appropriate tax will be added to the total, and appear on the payment receipt.
