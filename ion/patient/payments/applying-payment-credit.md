# Applying Payment Credit

Pharmacies can apply payment credits directly to a patient’s or organization’s payment page. This feature streamlines the process by automating store credits or cash reimbursements for payment adjustments, reducing the need for manual record-keeping and follow-ups. By offering flexible and efficient credit options, pharmacies can enhance their workflow and provide seamless resolution for any discrepancies or changes in payments.

## How to Add Credit for Adjustments to Paid Shipping Costs

1. **For Credit with Card Payment:**
   1. Add a line item with a negative price with a note in the description for clarity, and click **Add**. (Image 1)
   2. Select a credit card under Payment Method.
   3. Press the **Charge** button. This will create a credit line item under unbilled items, applying the credit to future billing. (Image 2)

2. **For Reimbursement with Cash Payment:**
   1. Add a line item with a negative price with a note for clarity.
   2. Select **Create Invoice** under Payment Method for the line item, and click Charge to generate an invoice. (Image 1)
   3. Clicking **Mark Paid** will move the invoice to the transaction history and display the credit or reimbursed, reflecting that the reimbursement was completed by cash or another method, not by credit. (Image 2 and 3)

Generating an invoice does not remove unbilled line items; they remain until the invoice is paid. Be sure to charge the invoice and not the unbilled item.
