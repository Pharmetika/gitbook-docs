## Controlled substance reporting for veterinary patients

For controlled substance prescriptions for a veterinary patient, enter the owner’s identification information, as required by state or federal regulations, by clicking the + Add button under 'Identity Information' on this form. Once all the information is entered, click Save.

This information should be entered in the Point of Contact form, not under the patient’s details, as it will be used for PMP reporting (i.e., a driver's license should not be entered for the the animal, animals cannot drive).

When reporting controlled substance for a veterinary patient, it's important to accurately record the owner's contact information for Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) purposes. This ensures proper tracking of controlled substance prescriptions, compliance with regulations, and data integrity. Without precise contact details, the data may not correctly reflect the responsible party, leading to potential issues in monitoring and accountability.
