# Invoice Visibility Configuration for the Portal

Pharmacies now have the ability to configure invoice visibility for providers and staff members in ION. This setting must be enabled for all **new** providers as required.

If additional staff members need invoice visibility, they must request access from the pharmacy, who will then grant the permission.

### To enable or disable invoice visibility for a provider or staff member

1. Under **Portal Management**, open the **Clinic List** and click **Edit** to access the desired clinic.
2. Ensure the user is associated with the clinic. If not, add the user.
3. Once the user is associated, click on **Permissions** to open the "Change User Permission" screen.

4. On this screen, select or deselect the option for **“Can Manage Invoices”** as needed.

A green confirmation message will appear at the top of the screen to confirm the change.

Once the "Can Manage Invoice" permission is granted in ION, portal users will see the **Invoices** tab on the left-side panel. If the permission is disabled, the **Invoices** tab will be hidden.
