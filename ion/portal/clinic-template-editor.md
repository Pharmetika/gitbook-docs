# Clinic Template Editor

## Overview

The Clinic Template Editor has much of the same core functionality as the [Pharmacy Template Editor](pharmacy-template-editor.md), with a few notable differences.

Most importantly, the templates created here are intended to be used by specific clinics and are not visible to all providers. You must assign these templates to individual clinics opening the edit screen of the target clinic (Portal > [Clinic List](clinic-list/)) and viewing the [Medication Template Access](clinic-list/#adding-medicati) section.

Note that, unlike the Pharmacy Template Editor, the total number of templates in the Clinic Template Editor is not a static list based on template types. You can add and remove as many templates as you'd like.

To create a new template, click the **Add Template** button in the top right corner. Be thoughtful in choosing a name for the template, as templates might be visible to multiple clinics.
