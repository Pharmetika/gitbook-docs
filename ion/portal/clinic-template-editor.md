# Clinic Template Editor

## Synopsis

The Clinic Template Editor has much of the same core functionality as the [Pharmacy Template Editor](pharmacy-template-editor.md), with a few notable differences.

Most importantly, the templates created here are intended to be used by specific clinics, and are not visible to all providers. You will need to assign these templates to individual clinics by navigating to the edit screen of the target clinic in the [Clinic List](clinic-list/), and looking under [Medication Template Access](clinic-list/#adding-medicati).

**Note:** Unlike the pharmacy template editor, the total number of templates is not a static list based on template types. You may add and remove as many templates as you'd like.

To create a new template, click the **Add Template +** button in the top right corner. Be thoughtful and verbose in choosing a name for the template, as templates may be visible to multiple clinics.
