# Adding Order Shipping Addresses to Organizations

In each organization, you can add shipping addresses that can be used for orders. To add a new address, click **+Add** in the **Order Shipping Addresses** sectio&#x6E;**.**

Addresses in this section are then available for orders that have the organization selected.

You can create a shipment directly from this section by clicking the **Create Shipment** button next to the address.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not use this button to create shipments for prescriptions. Shipments created in this way aren't linked to prescriptions, which makes it harder to track and manage those prescriptions. These shipments also don't appear in the Fill Report or in the provider portal.
{% endhint %}

This action creates a shipment that isn't linked to any prescriptions, which can be useful for shipping non-prescription items like brochures or extra supplies.
