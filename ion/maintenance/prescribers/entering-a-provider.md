# Entering a New Prescriber

Go to Maintenance > Prescribers and click **Add New Prescriber**. New prescribers can also be added by searching their name or NPI number in the search box. The fields will auto-populate with their details; ensure the information is accurate and up to date.

**Highlighting point:**

* Providers associated with multiple clinics can be distinguished each clinic in the "Description" field. (e.g., Happy Clinic - West Office).
* If the prescriber is auto-populated, verify the credential for accuracy, as it may differ by state (e.g., some states use APRN while others use ARPN).

## Additional Licenses and Qualifications

* For prescribers with multiple state licenses, expand the "Addtl. State Licenses" section to add more licenses.
* Prescribers with additional qualifications, such as controlled substance reporting (CSR), can be added by state under the "Addtl. Qualifications" field.
  * Select a state for the Issuer and choose the qualification type (e.g., Alabama and CSR). Click the "Add Addtl. Qualification" button and a second line will appear to enter the qualification number and expiration date.
  * To see a list of all prescribers in your system with this qualification, run the "Prescriber Addtl. Qualification List" report.
