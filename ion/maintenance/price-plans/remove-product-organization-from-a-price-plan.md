# Removing a Product or Organization from a Price Plan

If you attempt to delete a price plan with a product or organization link to it, the system prevents the deletion and prompts you to first unlink the product or organization. Removing the link prevents the price plan from being inadvertently removed from multiple products or organizations.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is important to remove a product or an organization **from** a price plan instead of attempting to remove the price plan from within the product or organization.
{% endhint %}

Go to **Maintenance** > **Price Plans** and click the **Edit** button on the right side of the price plan to open it.

If you attempt to remove a price plan that is currently linked to a product or organization, the system prevents the deletion and an alert message appears that prompts you to unlink the product or organization before you delete the price plan.
