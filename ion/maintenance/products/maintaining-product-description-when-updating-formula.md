# Maintaining Product Description When Updating Formula

Normally, the product description on the Product page in ION reflects what was entered in the Label Description field on the Formula page in Electric Lab.

Enabling the **“Do Not Overwrite Product Description When the Formula is Updated”** setting ensures that any saved or verified label description modifications in the lab do not overwrite the existing ION product name. This allows the lab team to update the formula, including product name changes, and re-verify it without affecting the product description in ION and on the patient label.

This change will only apply to new prescriptions entered **after** the setting is saved. Prescriptions that have already completed the creation and verification stages will not reflect this update on the patient label.

## Keeping Product Description Unchanged When Updating Formula

* Navigate to the Product page, search the product, check the option **"Do Not Overwrite Product Description When the Formula is Updated"** in the Product Option section, and click Save.
