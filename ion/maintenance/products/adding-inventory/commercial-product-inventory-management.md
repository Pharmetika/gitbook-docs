# Commercial Product Inventory Management

Inventory for commercial products can be entered by navigating to **Maintenance > Products**. From here, search for the existing product you wish to enter inventory for.

Once you've opened a commercial product, there will be an **Inventory** panel in the bottom right.

This lot will then be listed in the inventory, with the options to print a label or record a manual inventory adjustment.

You can scan this label when making dispenses to record use of inventory. Once inventory has been used from a lot, the quantity will display the remaining amount out of the total.

If a lot is fully removed from inventory, it will be crossed out in the inventory list, a label will not be able to be printed, and it will display removal details when expanded.
