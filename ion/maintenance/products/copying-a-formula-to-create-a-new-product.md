# Copying a Formula to Create a New Product

A single product may have different price plans depending on the end user, dispensing container, or whether a kit is attached. To differentiate between these, you can duplicate the product in the Product page, make necessary adjustments to the new entry. Despite having multiple entries, the inventory in ElectricLab will still deduct from the same product stock, ensuring accurate inventory management across multiple uses.

## Creating a New Product by Duplicating a Formula

1. Go to Maintenance > Product and search for an existing product. If you already know the product name, skip the search. Note the NDC number for step 5.

The newly created product will now be searchable under existing products. Users can locate it by name, verify the correct product by checking the NDC number at the prescription verification step.
