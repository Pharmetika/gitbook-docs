# Products

This tab is where users can search for an existing drug/product, add commercial products under **Drug Database**, and add any miscellaneous products that would need to be charged for (e.g. extra shipping cost). Formulas will be added through ElectricLab.

Users can also review reports for Inventory on Hand and Product List by clicking on the desired report.

The drop down menu shows the filters for the Inventory on Hand report, and users can check the 'Group by Lot Identifier' box to show all the different lot entries. If not checked, then the report will ONLY show an overall inventory for the drugs/products.

## Existing

For all drugs/products that have been added to the system, users can search when this selection has been chosen.

## Drug Database

When this has been selected, the user can select to add any drug/product that is commercially available. Users can either scan the UPC on the product or type the NDC to search the product that needs to be added. Once the desired product has been selected, click _Save_ in order to add the product to the system’s existing database.

* To update the manufacturer of a trade product, simply click the manufacturer link next to the product name, make the necessary updates, and then click Save to confirm the changes. This allows you to easily maintain accurate manufacturer information for trade products.

## New

This selection allows the user to manually add an item that’s custom or miscellaneous.

Once an item has been chosen from the search bar, users can make any edits to the product _excluding_ the NDC. When all edits have been made and finalized, click the **Save** button.
