# Reports for Accounting and Reconciliation

There are three different reports you can use to review transaction data:

* The **Transaction** report shows basic information about transactions. We recommend using this report to view refunds outside of the selected date range but associated with items in the date range.
* The **Transaction Details** report shows more details about transactions than the previous report. Use this report only for a summary of anticipated deposits to charges.
* The **Transaction Itemized** report shows a list of transactions during a specified time period in even greater detail. This report is useful for reconciling transactions with expected payments.

The **Transaction Itemized** report is the report that is most frequently used in reconciliation. Let’s take a closer look at this report, its settings, what data it shows, and how you can use that data.

## Transaction Itemized Report Settings

To run this report, you need to select a date range to search in the system. In the Date to Search By field, you can also select which type of date to use from any of the following options:

* **Date Charged.** This is the date a transaction was first placed on an invoice or the date it was marked paid, whichever occurred first.
* **Date of Charge.** This is the date the billable item associated with the transaction was created. For example, for a product charge, this is the date the technician clicked the Fill button, regardless of the date the fill was completed.
* **Date Payment Accepted.** This is the date the item is first marked as paid, either with a credit card charge or with another payment source.

You can also configure whether the system includes certain transactions in the report results with the following checkboxes:

* **Include Unpaid Items.** Select this checkbox to include billable items that do not have a payment accepted in your search. This also includes invoiced items that are not paid.
* **Include Transactions Reversed Inside of Date Range.** Select this checkbox to include payment transactions reversed within the selected time period in your search.
