## Enhancements

### Prescription Workflow Enhancements

* Some states require pharmacies to verify the patient’s identity by requiring identification from patients prior to dispensing a controlled substance, including for shipped prescriptions. To help your pharmacy comply with these requirements, the system now prevents you from creating a shipping label for a shipment containing a controlled substance if the shipping address is located in a state with this requirement and the patient does not have identity information on file. For these patients, this feature also blocks shipments of non-controlled substances required to be reported to PMPs in some states, such as gabapentin. This new feature will be enabled automatically for all pharmacies. Pharmacies should ensure they have an internal process for collecting identity information for the states that require it. Shipping labels can not be created without the identity information for the patient if the state requires it.

* The following new reasons for compounding are available to select in **Prescription Entry**:
  * Active Ingredient Sensitivity/Allergy
  * Decreased Side Effects
  * Dose Adjustment Necessary
  * Other
  * Therapeutic Difference
* With the new address lookup feature, typing in the beginning of an address brings up a list of suggested verified addresses from an open-source street map database, with the ones closest to you appearing first. When you select an address from the dropdown menu, the rest of the address information is automatically entered in the window, and the address is automatically verified. This feature makes it faster and easier to add new shipping addresses for both patients and organizations.

* You can group price plans together with the new Price Plan Groups feature, which makes it easier to manage large numbers of price plans at an organizational level. For more information, [click here](../maintenance/price-plan-groups.md).

### Administrative Reporting Enhancements

* Added the **ERXs Missing Entries** report, which helps you review and follow up on electronic prescriptions received in your system that haven’t yet been converted into ION prescriptions. This report is particularly useful for making sure that pharmacy users are following recommended procedures for processing electronic prescriptions in your system. (PHA-2427)
* Added the **Inventory Log Transactions** report, which helps you track how often your product inventory is manually modified and for what reasons.
* The following new columns were added to the **Recent Fills** report in the Practitioner Portal to help prescribers more easily access tracking information:
  * Pending Tracking ID
  * Date Pending Shipping Label Created
