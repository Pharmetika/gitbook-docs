## Enhancements

*   To help prevent users from sending medications to restricted states, the system has an additional check for state-level restrictions when a user creates a shipping label. This check is useful in cases when the shipping address is changed in between filling and shipping. Note that the system doesnâ€™t check conditional restrictions at this point.

*   Pharmacies can now reprint or void an existing shipping label or generate a new one for orders that have not yet left the pharmacy or been scanned by the carrier. From the Existing Shipment Found window, users can reprint the existing shipping label, void the existing label, or create a new shipping label. If the user creates a new label, they can then select whether to add a shipping charge. When an existing label is voided and a new shipment is created, the original shipment identifier remains, but a new tracking ID is linked to the order. This feature prevents the system from creating multiple identical tracking IDs, which can cause subsequent payment errors.

## Fixes

* If users need to access the tracking ID recorded for manual recorded shipments at a later date, it now appears in the Tracking ID column on the Fill Report.
* The commercial product insufficient inventory warning now appears as expected when the default dispense quantity exceeds the inventory.
