## Improvements

* Added a filter box on the payment transaction history pages for both patients and organizations. This is particularly beneficial for organizations managing numerous invoices, as it allows for easier searching of invoices by specific products or prescription numbers.

* Added a cost column for shipment cost on the shipment list page.
* Added an additional optional column in the fill report to include the original prescription document. If the prescription document was uploaded like a PDF, it'll be a link directly to the PDF. If it's an ERX, it'll just be a link to the prescription entry.
* Added a ‘prescription range’ field in the fill report, listing all prescriptions filled between a specified start and end dates. Click [here ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ddauzqg0qaWLDyp7xiL_cvCwE65oopG5/view?usp=sharing)for the guide.
