## Enhancements

### Administrative Enhancements

* The new Active Patients report shows all active patients. This report is especially helpful for finding active patients without active prescriptions so pharmacists and providers can work together to ensure that patients remain compliant with their medications.
*   You can now filter prescriptions that appear on the Prescription Entry by Date report by whether they are active or inactive.&#x20;

### Prescription Workflow Enhancements 

* When the acquisition price is higher than the billable item price on the Fill screen, a warning now appears. This feature can help prevent revenue loss from accidental or inappropriate pricing.

*   Select the Use product description from dispensed product on fill label checkbox to show the description of the product that was actually dispensed instead of the product description from the prescription entry on the patient fill label. This feature is useful in scenarios where one generic product is substituted for an identical product.&#x20;

*   Federal law requires that controlled substances be dispensed and shipped directly to the ultimate user, which is typically the patient. To prevent users from unintentionally shipping controlled substances to clinics, a warning now appears when a user attempts to ship an order that contains a controlled substance to a clinic address or to an address that uses the prescriber’s name instead of the patient’s name.&#x20;

Note the system can’t evaluate whether an address is a clinic address if a pharmacy manually adds the clinic address to a patient profile, so the warning doesn’t appear in that scenario. Currently, this feature only applies to orders, and the system is unable to check for a clinic address outside of orders.
