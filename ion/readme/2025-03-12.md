## Enhancements

* If you submit controlled substances to a state database, you can now enter your SFTP username and password directly in your state-specific settings. To use these settings, you first must register with the appropriate state database. For more information, click [here](../utilities/system-configurations/state-settings/configuring-sftp-credentials-by-state.md).
* The Prescription Entry by Date report now includes a column that indicates whether the prescription is active.
* The Fill Report now includes two new columns:
  * One column shows the electronic prescription order number when applicable. To see this column, check the Include Additional Identifiers checkbox in the report settings.
  *   One column shows the pending tracking ID for a shipment. To see this column, select Date Pending Shipping Label Created in the Select additional columns field in the report settings.

*   The Transaction Itemized report now includes a column that shows the tax for an individual item for organizations that use Avalara tax software integration. This column can help you break down total tax into tax on specific items in an order or shipment. If you donâ€™t integrate with Avalara, this column will show a value of 0.00 for all items.
