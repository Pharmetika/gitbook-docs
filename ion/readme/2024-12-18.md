## Enhancements:

* Extended instructions on patient prescription labels will now overflow onto a second label when necessary, with a character limit capped at 1000. The second label will display only the medication name and the instructions. This feature is enabled by default, and no additional configuration is required.
* Added additional columns to the end of the Fill Report to provide enhanced shipping details. Before generating the report, add Shipping Status at the bottom of the Fill Report screen. This update provides more comprehensive and detailed shipping information. New columns include: shipping address and holder type details.
