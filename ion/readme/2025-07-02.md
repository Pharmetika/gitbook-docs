## Enhancements

* You can select the **Exclude prescription entry tasks from task queue** checkbox in **System Settings** to remove tasks of the following types from the **Task Queue**:
  * New Formulation Request
  * New Prescription
  * Prescription Clarification
  * Prescription Entry
  * Prescription Entry Verification

We recommend that larger pharmacies that enter prescription data from the **Rx Entry** queue implement this feature, because it helps the **Task Queue** to load faster and contain only the most useful tasks.
