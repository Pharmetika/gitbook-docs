## Enhancements

* Added a “Requires Signature When Shipped” setting to ensure products requiring a signature are correctly marked during shipping. If the shipment settings do not align, a hard stop with a red alert will prompt the user to enable the signature requirement before completing the shipment. Click [here](../maintenance/products/ensuring-signature-requirement-for-shipments.md) for more details.&#x20;
* Added a feature to set minimum and maximum day supply limits for specific products, which display on the Prescription Entry and Fill screens. A hard stop will prevent verification if the day supply falls outside the range, while a soft stop on the Fill screen allows the fill to proceed with an alert. Click [here](../maintenance/products/setting-minimum-and-maximum-day-supply-for-products.md) for more details.&#x20;
* Added a customizable date range feature for the Prescription Entry Queue to improve organization and streamline workflows. Users can manually filter by date on the page, set a default range in System Settings, or rely on the 7-day default if no settings are configured.

* Pharmacies can now apply payment credits directly to a patient’s or organization’s payment page, streamlining store credits and reimbursements for payment adjustments. This feature enhances workflow efficiency and simplifies resolving discrepancies. Click [here](../patient/payments/applying-payment-credit.md) for more details.&#x20;

## Bug fixes

* Whenever a new product is added to an order, the order must be saved before clicking **Fill**. The **Fill** option will remain disabled until the updates are saved.&#x20;
