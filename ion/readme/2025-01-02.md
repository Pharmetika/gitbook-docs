## Enhancements:

* Added the ability to scan barcodes to quickly access prescription information or product monographs directly from the Dispensing Queue page. The barcodes can be found under Maintenance, then System of Barcodes, and are labeled as “Open Information Sheet” and “Open Monograph.”

* Added a notification system to alert users when a fill already exists in another order. If a user attempts to submit an order with the same fill in a different order, the system will display a top message listing the relevant order numbers and a bottom notification showing the fill prescription number and its associated alternate orders. This is a soft notification, allowing the user to proceed if necessary.

* Added the capability to place prescriptions on hold at the prescription entry level. Prescriptions placed on hold will not appear in the patient profile, will be removed from the Task queue, and will be hidden in the Prescription Entry queue. These prescriptions can only be viewed by filtering the “On Hold” status in the Rx Entry Queue. This feature does not require pharmacist verification or completion of prescription fields to activate.
