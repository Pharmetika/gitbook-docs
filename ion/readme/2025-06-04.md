## Enhancements

* For controlled substances submitted directly to state PMPs using Pharmetika’s PMP integration, you can now see information about the fill’s last PMP submission and resubmit failed submissions directly from the **Fill History** window. For more information, click here.

* Prescribers can now attach documents to a new prescription submitted in the Practitioner Portal. Then, users in ION can view and download that file everywhere the prescription information appears, including in the **Prescription Entry**, **Fill**, and **Dispense** activities. This feature is especially useful for prescriptions that require lab results or an attached document such as a PDF or an image.
