## Features

* Added hotkeys to the prescription entry page, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VGEcwlb7eKgq3KmamskY0wHVPdmGwwuX/view?usp=sharing) for the guide.
* Added another panel “Recent Activities” on the bottom of the portal dashboard. This will display recent changes to an e-prescription to increase visibility after submission to the pharmacy, before it is entered and filled, this does not apply to refills on the same prescription. Reauthorization with or without changes are considered new orders. This panel can also be viewed in the patient profile in the portal and the display is in chart format.

## Improvements

* Added the ability to interchangeably dispense a “commercially available” 503b product with a 503a product or formula.
* Added 3 military bases (Armed Forces of America - Miami, Armed Forces of Europe - New York, and Armed Forces of the Pacific - Hawaii) for shipping. To set up the bases, go to Utilities > State Settings
