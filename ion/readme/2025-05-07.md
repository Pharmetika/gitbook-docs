## Enhancements

*   A warning message appears when a user attempts to void a fill that was paid for. This warning alerts users to address the payment when voiding the fill.

* If a prescription was filled prior to the **Halt Fill** feature checkbox being enabled, a warning message appears when a user attempts to dispense the prescription. This additional check alerts users when dispensing prescriptions that are intended to be held.&#x20;
