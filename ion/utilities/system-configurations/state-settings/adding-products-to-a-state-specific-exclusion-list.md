# Adding Products to a State-Specific Exclusion List

Pharmacies have the option to add products to a state-specific exclusion list, which may be required for states that restrict or prohibit out-of-state or nonresident pharmacies from shipping in certain medications. These restrictions may apply to individual products or broader categories, such as any product containing a specific ingredient.&#x20;

\
This process is NDC-specific and applies to both product-specific and ingredient-specific restrictions. If certain strengths for a product are restricted, each product strength must be added to the exclusion list individually. For NDC-specific ingredients, each manufacturer’s NDC must also be added to ensure all relevant formulas are restricted. For example, if restricting all formulas containing testosterone, add every manufacturer’s NDCs the pharmacy uses for testosterone to the exclusion list for that state restricting it.

This feature applies to non-resident pharmacies shipping into other states. It is important to ensure that the appropriate hand-off method is set for the prescription at the time of filling, as it will only apply to shipping and delivery. If a patient is picking up the prescription, the restriction does not apply.

To add a product to a state-specific exclusion list, follow these steps:

### Access State Settings

Select the state for which you want to add an exclusion product and click **Configure.**

Enter the product name, then select the correct item from the drop-down list of existing product entries in ION. After selecting the product, choose an exclusion option:

1. **Allowed in State:** This option is not currently active and will be enabled at a future date.
2. **Disallowed in State:** If selected, provide an exclusion reason (optional).
3. **Allowed Conditionally:** If selected, provide an exclusion reason and qualification criteria, both are optional.

Once all details are complete, click **Save**. The product will now appear on the “Product Exclusion List” for that state.

### Product Restrictions in the Fill Process

* **Conditionally Allowed Products:** When filling a prescription for a product that is allowed conditionally, a warning will appear, with a message stating the product’s conditional allowance in that state. The user must click Proceed to complete the fill.
