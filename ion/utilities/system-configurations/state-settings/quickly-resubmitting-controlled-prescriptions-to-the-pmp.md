# Quickly Resubmitting Controlled Prescriptions to the PMP

If you submit to state PMPs using Pharmetika’s integration instead of a third-party system like Speedscript, you can view and act on information about a controlled substance’s PMP submission from the **Fill History** window in the **Patient Summary**. To see this information, click **PMP Details** for a controlled substance prescription. This button appears only for controlled substances.

In the **PMP Details** window, you can see the last date and time the prescription was submitted (1) and the date the prescription left the pharmacy (2). You can also click the **Request Resubmission** button (3), which automatically begins the process to resubmit the prescription to the PMP.
