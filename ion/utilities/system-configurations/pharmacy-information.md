### Pharmacy Information

Fill out general information, address, and contact information accurately. The information the pharmacy fills out appears on the patient and organization receipt and on the prescription information sheet.&#x20;

The following fields are included on patient prescription labels, invoices and receipts, and unit dose labels:

* **General Information** section → **Pharmacy Name** field&#x20;
* All of the fields in the **Address** section
* **Contact Information** section → **800 Phone Numbe**r field

Make sure you enter a value in the **800 Phone Number** field even if your pharmacy doesn't use a 1-800 number. If you don't use one, enter your local number in this field. Leaving this field blank can prevent your users from creating shipments.
