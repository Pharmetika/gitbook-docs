# Select a Workflow on Prescription Entry

If the pharmacy chooses to not attach the workflow to an organization, the workflow can be manually selected during prescription entry and when filling prescriptions.

To attach a workflow on a prescription entry, the user can select the desired workflow from the fill options on the right side of the prescription entry. All workflows will display in the drop down menu from the fill option. Once the desired workflow is selected, the set selections will display for that workflow.

* If the workflow is chosen at prescription entry, the workflow will attach to the prescription entry verification task and when filling the prescription.
* Note to pharmacy, if the setting 'Disable Newly Created Prescription Task' is selected on the workflow, the newly created task will not display upon prescription entry verification. The user should choose to fill upon verification in prescription entry verification or create a patient task to schedule a patient call to fill.
