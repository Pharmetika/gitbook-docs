# Filter by Workflow in the Dispensing Queue

When utilizing a custom workflow, you can apply it as a filter within the **Dispensing Queue**. To do this, simply search by the desired workflow and select the option to display only prescriptions associated with it. Alternatively, you can invert the filter to hide all prescriptions tied to that specific workflow, streamlining the dispensing queue for other tasks.
