# Workflows

Custom workflows are a tool for managing prescription entries and fills by defining specific handoff methods, setting priorities, and automating certain processes. These workflows enable pharmacies to standardize and streamline operations, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and accurately.

Workflows can be tailored to meet the unique needs of the pharmacy, allowing for the seamless management of priorities such as urgent prescriptions, skipping ready queue barcode scanning, or disabling the automatic creation of newly created prescription tasks. By attaching custom workflows to prescriptions, pharmacies can optimize their operations, and improve task delegation.
