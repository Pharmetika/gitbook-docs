# Provider Portal Registration

The pharmacy will send a portal invitation to the email address provided by the provider. Each provider should have a unique email address and that they have direct access to this account. The provider should start their part of the process by clicking **Create Account**.&#x20;

## On the first page

The prescriber needs to verify their information, add a collaborating provider if applicable, and indicate if they are a veterinarian.

### Key Points:&#x20;

* The username must be at least five characters long.&#x20;
* The provider’s email should be a unique email address that they can access directly. This is important for providers who will need an EPCS token to prescribe controlled substances in the portal.
* If the provider wants to use an alternate email address, they will need to reach out to the pharmacy to update that information.

## On the second page

There are **three** different scenarios for linking a clinic with a provider.&#x20;

1. To prevent linking issues between the provider and the clinic, it is best practice to link the clinic to the provider’s portal invitation. This will automatically display the designated clinic on the registration form.
2. If the provider is not yet linked to a clinic in ION, they can enter the necessary information to create one.
3. If the provider’s address matches an existing clinic in ION, the system will prompt them to either select the existing clinic or create a new one.

## On the third page

The provider must create a password that meets all of the following requirements:

* Must be at least eight characters long
* Must contain at least one capital letter
* Must contain at least one number
* Must start with either a letter or number, not a symbol

A circular checkmark icon will appear once the criteria are met, confirming that the password is valid for creating the new user account.
