# Order Fulfillment

Orders can be fulfilled either in the **Prescription Hand-off** activity, or from the **Order Fulfillment** activity.

Fulfilling an order from the **Order Fulfillment** activity works similarly to order reconciliation:

1. Select the order.
2. Scan each item.&#x20;
3. You are prompted to create a shipment for shipped orders. If you don't create a shipment, the order items are marked as Picked Up for pick-up orders.

When fulfilling orders from the **Prescription Hand-off** activity, find the order items and select them. You can adjust the order filtering to make this easier.

If you only select some but not all of the order items, a warning appears when you try to create a shipment.

Once all order items are selected, you can create the shipment as usual.
