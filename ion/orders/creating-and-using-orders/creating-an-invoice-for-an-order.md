Next to the invoice number, a dollar amount for the invoice appears, reflecting the total invoice amount, including items, shipping costs, and any applicable handoff method surcharges. This total also appears in the Payment activity for the patient. Possible surcharges might include:&#x20;

* Signature upon delivery fees.
* Cold shipping fees for temperature-sensitive products.
* Additional charges based on specific handoff methods.
