* Next to the Invoice Number: A dollar sign and an amount will appear, reflecting the total invoice amount, which includes items, shipping costs, and any applicable handoff method surcharges. This is the same total that will appear on the Patient Payment page. These surcharges may include:&#x20;
  * Signature upon delivery fees
  * Cold shipping fees for temperature-sensitive products
  * Additional charges based on specific handoff methods.
* Under "Order Info": A few lines above, users will see another dollar amount, which represents the order total excluding surcharges.&#x20;
