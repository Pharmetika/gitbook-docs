# Creating and Using Orders

1. There are multiple ways to begin creating a new order:

* You can create a new order from the **Orders** section of the **Patient Summary**. When you create an order this way, that patient is automatically added to the new order.

## Adding a Prescription in Ready Status to an Order

Prescriptions with a status of Ready can be added to an order by scanning the transaction ID on the prescription label. After scanning, the patient and prescription details appear on the screen within a few seconds. This feature is useful for pharmacies that want to quickly add ready prescriptions to an order for shipping and invoicing.

Scan the transaction ID barcode into the **Add Item** field to load the patient and prescription information on the screen.

## Filling Orders

To fill items in an order, find the order, either in the **Orders** section in the Patient Summary, or in the **Order Queue.**

Once you've found the order you want to fill items for, use the arrow on the left side to expand the order. Once the order is expanded, you'll see **Fill** buttons for each item that has not yet been filled.&#x20;

When you click this button to fill an item, the quantity, handoff method, notes, ready-by date, and priority are automatically filled with what was selected for the order.

Once you fill an item, the order is updated to indicate that item has been filled.
