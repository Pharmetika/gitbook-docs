# Submitting an Order and Sending an Intent

### From Prescription Entry

Once the last prescription in the **New Prescription** task has been entered, mark the task ready for verification and click **Save**. The user can then go into the order from the prescription entry by clicking on **Create Order**, scrolling down, and clicking **Submit Order & Send Intent**.

Only click **Submit Order** or **Submit Order & Send Intent** after all prescriptions have been added to the order.

If the user clicks **Submit Order & Send Intent**, the order is updated to show that an intent has been sent.

### From Prescription Entry Verification

The intent can also be sent from prescription entry verification. In prescription entry verification, the blue button will change to **Edit Order**. Once clicked, the **Manage Order** screen appears as a side window. The pharmacist can verify all information filled out in the order and click **Submit Order & Send Intent** or **Send Order Review Request.**

If an Intent was sent to the patient in prescription entry, this intent appears on the order in prescription entry verification.
