# Reactivating an Order

1. If the items were not removed but the **invoice was deleted along with cancelling the order**, the canceled order will appear in the **Order Queue** with a <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> **strikethrough** on its text.
2. To reactivate the order:
   1. Open the canceled order.
   2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Reactivate** button (red).
   3. A prompt will appear, asking for confirmation to reactivate.
   4. Confirm by clicking **Yes**.
   5. The order will be reinstated, and any filled items will remain connected to the order.
