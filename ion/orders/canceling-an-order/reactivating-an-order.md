# Reactivating an Order

If the items were not removed but the invoice was deleted along with cancelling the order, the canceled order appears in the **Order Queue** with a <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> strikethrough.

To reactivate the order:

1. Open the canceled order.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Reactivate** button.
3. A prompt appears, asking for confirmation to reactivate.
4. Confirm by clicking **Yes**.
5. The order is reinstated, and any filled items remain connected to the order.
