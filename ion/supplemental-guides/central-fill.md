# Central Fill

With central fill, an originating pharmacy receives a prescription and then a second fulfillment pharmacy dispenses the prescription. The originating pharmacy owns the prescription and all the associated details and functions for the prescription, while the fulfillment pharmacy prepares and ships the dispense.

Keep in mind the following definitions as you read further:

* _**Central Fill:**_ A system where one fulfillment pharmacy acts as a centralized hub for prescription fulfillment, preparing medications on behalf of originating pharmacies.
* _**Originating Pharmacy:**_ The pharmacy that receives a prescription, enters data for the prescription in the system, provides clinical screening, and fills the prescription. This pharmacy is responsible for maintaining the relationship with the patient and provider. However, the originating pharmacy might not be able to fulfill the prescription, or might want another pharmacy to provide fulfillment.
* _**Fulfillment Pharmacy:**_ The pharmacy that prepares and then ships or delivers the dispense to the patient.

Laws regarding central fill and whether or not prescriptions can be filled outside of the originating pharmacy vary by state and it is the pharmacy’s responsibility to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.
{% endhint %}

Here’s an example scenario of how central fill works in Pharmetika:

1.  The originating pharmacy, pharmacy A, receives a prescription for a patient, which the pharmacy elects to centrally fill. When filling the prescription, the originating pharmacy user completes the necessary fields, including **Handoff Method** and **Ready By**. The user also selects pharmacy B as the fulfillment pharmacy.&#x20;

2. The user at pharmacy A clicks the **Fill** button. Only pharmacy A can edit the fill details, which are shown in the image above.
3. The fulfillment pharmacy, pharmacy B, receives the dispense in the Dispense Queue.
4. The medication is prepared for the patient in the same manner as a standard dispense, and the system decrements pharmacy B’s inventory.
5. The originating pharmacy manages any necessary payment, and the prescription is shipped from the fulfillment pharmacy. The label on the prescription shows information for both pharmacies.
