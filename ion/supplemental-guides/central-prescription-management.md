# Central Prescription Management

The Central Prescription Management module lets you manage prescription entries and view dispenses for all pharmacy locations in one place.

The Central Prescription Management module provides access to the Rx Entry Queue and the Dispensing Queue across all of an organization's locations. To access the module, users can click the three dots at the top of the screen to open the Tools menu, then click the **Federation Dashboard** button.

The Rx Entry Queue shows all incoming prescriptions across all of your pharmacies. Similar to the Rx Entry Queue in ION, users can open a prescription entry in the respective pharmacy’s ION system by clicking the blue **View** arrow. This functionality is useful if one or more users at your organization complete data entry for all prescriptions across all your pharmacies.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rules and regulations regarding prescription data entry vary by state. It is the pharmacy’s responsibility to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.

The Dispensing Queue in the Central Management Dashboard shows a list of all products ready to be dispensed across all your pharmacies. This Dispensing Queue looks similar to the one found in ION, but it is read-only and lets you see how many prescriptions are ready for dispensing across all your pharmacies without having to open each pharmacy’s system.&#x20;

Here are the most important parts of the Dispensing Queue for Central Prescription Management:&#x20;

A. _**Dispensing - Check/Verify** section._ This section shows information about the selected dispense. From here, you can review important information about the dispense before you take action.&#x20;

B. _**Dispensing Queue** section._ This section shows all the prescriptions available to dispense, filtered by the criteria you choose.&#x20;

C. _**Open in Fulfillment Pharmacy** button._ Click here to open the fulfillment pharmacy’s system for the dispense. After you log in, the dispense that currently appears in the Dispensing - Check/Verify section (A) opens in the fulfillment pharmacy’s system for review.&#x20;
