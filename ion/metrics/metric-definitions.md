# Metric Definitions

There are several user metrics reports that can be run from the metrics page in Ion. Pharmacist users see these metrics broken down per user, but technicians see only the totals.

* **Prescriptions Entered:** Lists prescriptions entered, logged for the user who first saved the prescription in any status.
* **Prescriptions Verified:** Lists prescriptions verified by pharmacist, logged for the pharmacist when they mark the prescription as verified.
