# Using On Hold Status in Prescription Entry

Prescription entries can be placed on hold directly from the Prescription Entry page. Entries on hold will not display in the patient profile and will only be visible in the Prescription Entry Queue when filtered by the “On Hold” status. This functionality does not require pharmacist verification or the completion of prescription fields.

### Placing a Prescription Entry On Hold

On the Prescription Entry page, a prescription can be placed on hold, regardless of whether the information is complete, by selecting the “On Hold” status and clicking Save. This will change the prescription status from “In Process” to “On Hold,” removing it from the main Prescription Entry queue. The prescription entry will only be visible when the appropriate filter is applied.

### Processing On Hold Prescription Entries

To view and process prescription entries in the queue, navigate to the Prescription Entry Queue page. Select the “Prescription Entry” filter at the top of the Filters box. This will allow you to refine the queue based on specific criteria.

To narrow the list to only on-hold prescription entries, choose the “On Hold” status at the bottom of the Filters box. Additionally, make sure to select the Date of Data Entry and set a broad date range to ensure a comprehensive list of on-hold prescription entries are displayed.
