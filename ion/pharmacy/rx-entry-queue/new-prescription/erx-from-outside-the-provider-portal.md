# eRx from outside the Provider Portal

## Electronic Prescriptions

These electronic prescriptions may contain some additional patient health data, such as clinical observations, allergies, and benefits. The additional data points sent from the provider will appear in the center of the eRx page. The blue bubbles indicate the number of entries for that category. Any necessary changes can be made by editing the patient's profile.

Clinical observations may include information such as patient's body weight, body height, systolic, diastolic blood pressure, etc.

This is a prescription-level list of allergies from the provider's office and it is attached to a specific electronic prescription. The allergies listed here are not linked to the patient's profile allergies. Therefore, it is necessary to cross-check with the patient-level list at the bottom of the prescription entry page before adding new entries. Pharmacies can update the allergy list in the patient profile during the prescription entry step by adding allergies from this page. Once the appropriate allergies are selected, this list will remain visible whenever the prescription is accessed; it will not disappear. If the patient profile has not been created and it is decided to add the allergies at the prescription level later, the Add buttons will remain active for future use.

### Adding an allergy to patient profile

Select the patient first to enable the Add buttons on this list. A pop-up will then appear with an allergy form to complete. The allergy will auto-populate in the form as free text, and the pharmacy will need to search and select the appropriate allergy from the drop-down list.

Benefits includes the patient's insurance information.

Prescriptions that contain a start date for patient's to begin therapy will also be displayed on the eRx under the Date Written line. This date refers to any date mentioned on the prescriptions other than the original written date.

### Reviewing Supervising Physician Information

Some practitioners, depending on state regulations, practice under the supervision of a licensed physician. If a supervising physician is associated with the practitioner, pharmacists can verify this relationship by clicking the Supervisor link on the eRx during prescription data verification.
