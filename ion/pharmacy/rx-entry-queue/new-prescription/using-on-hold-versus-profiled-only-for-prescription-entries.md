# Using 'On Hold' versus 'Profiled Only' for Prescription Entries

The **On Hold** and **Profiled Only** features help pharmacies manage prescription entries more easily. The **On Hold** feature lets the you pause on prescription entry at a clinic’s request until it’s ready to be processed. The **Profiled Only** feature allows you to pause at prescription entry at the pharmacy's request and link the entry to a patient’s profile without assigning a prescription number until it’s verified.

For more details about each feature and how they work, see below.

## Placing a Prescription Entry On Hold

The **On Hold** feature is specifically designed for instances when clinics or prescribers request that a prescription be set aside until further notice. This feature provides a streamlined way for pharmacies to pause data entry without advancing them in the workflow, ensuring they are easily retrievable when needed.&#x20;

### Key Characteristics

• **Not Linked to Patient Profile:** Prescriptions marked as “On Hold” are not directly associated with the patient’s profile.

• **Location for Retrieval:** The only place to locate “On Hold” prescription entries is the Prescription Entry Queue, where specific filters must be applied to view them.

## Marking a Prescription Entry to be Profiled Only

The **Profiled Only** feature is designed to assist pharmacies in organizing prescription entries that are not immediately ready for verification. Unlike the On Hold feature, prescriptions marked as Profiled Only are directly tied to the patient’s medication history and appear in their Patient Summary. However, they are not assigned a prescription number until they undergo verification.

### Key Characteristics

• **Linked to Patient Profile:** Profiled prescription entries are list under the patient’s prescription history on the Patient Summary page for easy reference.

• **Pending Prescription Number:** These entries do not have a prescription number until verification is completed.
