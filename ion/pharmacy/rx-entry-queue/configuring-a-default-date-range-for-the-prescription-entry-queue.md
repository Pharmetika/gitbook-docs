# Configuring a Default Date Range for the Prescription Entry Queue

In the Prescription Entry Queue, the pharmacy can set date ranges to enhance organization and streamline workflows. Users can manually filter prescriptions by date directly on the page, set a default date range through System Settings for automatic application, or rely on the systemâ€™s default seven-day range if no configurations are made. This feature can help pharmacies to better manage and prioritize prescription processing based on their operational needs.

The system determines what date range to use on the Prescription Entry page as follows:

1. Date filter on Prescription Entry Queue page
2. Custom default date range configured in System Settings
3. Default seven-day range

This logic ensures flexibility while maintaining an organized workflow.

## Adding a date range filter on the Prescription Entry page

By default, the **Date Sent** filter is selected, allowing you to choose a date range to view prescriptions received by the pharmacy.

Note: For prescriptions pending clarification that have been in the queue for some time, switch the filter to **Date of Data Entry** to locate them.
