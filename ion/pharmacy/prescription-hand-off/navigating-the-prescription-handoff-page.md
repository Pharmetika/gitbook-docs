# Navigating the Prescription Handoff Page

The Prescription Handoff page provides multiple navigation options, allowing users to filter and sort handoff method options for greater ease of use. This functionality helps users access specific workflows more efficiently and tailor the handoff process according to their operational needs.

### Selecting All Handoff Methods

Select the required handoff methods on the left. In this example, all five are selected (Pick-up, Mail/Shipping, Delivery, Office, and Facility). On the right side, 22 out of 22 available handoff methods options are selected, to see all 22 options, hover over the Additional Methods box. When all options are selected, the search bar is disabled. If any options are deselected, the search bar becomes available to search for missing options.

### Adding Handoff Method Options

To make prescriptions reappear in the "Scan Out List," reselect the desired handoff methods on the left. In this example, "Mail/Shipping" was reselected, and 12 out of 22 options, along with their prescriptions, reappeared. Alternatively, if the user wants to work on specific handoff method options, they can search and add them individually.
