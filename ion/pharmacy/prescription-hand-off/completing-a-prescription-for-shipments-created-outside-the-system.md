# Completing a Prescription for Shipments Created Outside the System

Pharmacies can record information for manual shipments, allowing them to document shipments created outside of the system. This feature enables the pharmacy to add shipment notes, enter tracking IDs, and input the date the package was shipped. Currently, the date is displayed on the Fill Report.

## Using Manual Shipment

• Navigate to the Prescription Handoff page and ensure the prescription is in the Ready-Ship status.

• Move the prescription from the Ready box to the Complete box.

• At the bottom of the Complete box, click the **Record Manual Shipment** button (formerly Save and Update) to open the pop-up screen.
