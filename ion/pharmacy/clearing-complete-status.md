# Clearing Complete Status

The **Clear Complete Status** button in the Dispensing Queue allows users to change the status of a prescription from Complete to Incomplete in order to void a dispense, delete a fill, and return inventory back to stock.

## Where to Find the Button

The Clear Complete Status button is available in two locations:

1.  **Dispensing Queue:**

    1. After pulling up a completed prescription, the button appears on the dispensing screen, located next to the Print Shipping Label button on the right side of the screen.
