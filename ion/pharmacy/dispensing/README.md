# Dispensing Queue

The Dispensing Queue is where users can see all prescriptions that need to be dispensed. Users can choose from different filters to view only what they want to focus on.

The following color-coding helps you prioritize dispenses:

<mark style="color:red;">**Red:**</mark> Prescriptions that have been marked as Urgent.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Yellow:**</mark> Prescriptions that have been marked as Elevated.

**White:** Prescriptions that are to be filled with Normal processing time.

**Gray:** Prescriptions with a product that is on backorder.

The following icons help you understand the prescription's payment status:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (372).png>): Prescription has been paid.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (374).png>): Prescription is billed through the clinic, and needs payment.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (375).png>): Prescription needs payment.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (377).png>): Prescription doesn't have a dollar amount.
