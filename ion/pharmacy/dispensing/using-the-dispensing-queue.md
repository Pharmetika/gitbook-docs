2. **Rx Number:** This filter shows all fills for a prescription, regardless of your date filled or status filters.

   * Compounding-queued

   * Dispensed
   * Filled
5. This button refreshes your Dispensing Queue. Click this button after changing the **Status** or **Date Filled** filters.

1. In the **Search** field, you can search the Dispensing Queue. You can search by patient name and date of birth, prescription number, drug description, and prescriber name.
2. Click the gear icon to adjust which columns appear in your Dispensing Queue. Because there's a lot of information here, it may be beneficial to disable any columns that aren't useful.

By clicking the sort arrows above any of the columns, you can sort the Dispensing Queue by that column in ascending or descending order. By default, the Dispensing Queue is sorted by date filled in descending order.

To select a fill for dispensing, click the prescription number.

At the bottom of this section is the list of dispenses for the selected fill. Here you can find all dispenses made for the fill, the beyond use date, the lot number (if applicable), the quantity dispensed, when it was prepared, checked, and verified, and who completed each step. You can also print a label for a specific dispense (if you have multiple dispenses on a single fill) and void the dispense.

## Dispensing a Fill

To dispense a fill, first pull up the fill you want to make a dispense for. Scan the product for that fill into the product scan field, then enter some information before recording that dispense. For commercial products, you'll be able to enter a quantity, lot number, and beyond use date. For compounded products, you'll only be able to enter a quantity.

Once you've entered any information here, you can click the **Record & Label** button to record this dispense. If you're dispensing the full amount for that fill, a label is automatically generated and the system prompts you to print it. If you are dispensing from two lots into separate containers, you'll need to scroll down and print a label from the dispense list for each container. If you're dispensing from two lots into the same container, you'll need to print a label from the **Print Label** button at the top of the screen.
