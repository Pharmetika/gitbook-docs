2. **Rx Number Filter:** This will show all fills for an Rx, regardless of your date filled or status filters.
3. **Ready By Date Filter:** This will filter results by the fill Ready By Date. Only fills with a ready by date set in the date range selected will show in the list.

6. This button will display/hide additional filters (items 7-10).
7. **Order Filter:** This can be set to include order items (displays all items), exclude order items, or show order items only.

## Queue Display Settings

1. **Search Field:** In this search field you can search the dispensing queue. You can search by patient name and DOB, Rx#, drug description, and prescriber name.
2. **Column Display Settings:** Here you can adjust which columns to show in your dispensing queue. Because there's a lot of information here, it may be beneficial to disable any columns that aren't useful.

By clicking the sort arrows above any of the columns, you can sort the dispensing queue by that column ascending or descending. By default, the dispensing queue is sorted by date filled in descending order.

To select a fill for dispensing, simply click the Rx#.

At the bottom of this section is the list of dispenses for the selected fill. This will display all dispenses made for the fill, the beyond use date, the lot # (if applicable), quantity dispensed, when it was prepared, checked, and verified, and who completed each step. From here you can also print a label for a specific dispense (if you have multiple dispenses on a single fill) and void the dispense.

## Dispensing a Fill

To dispense a fill, first pull up the fill you want to make a dispense for. Scan the product for that fill into the product scan field, and you will be able to enter some information before recording that dispense. For commercial products, you'll be able to enter a quantity, lot number, and beyond use date. For compounded products, you'll only be able to enter a quantity.

Once you've entered any information here, you can click the **Record & Label** button to record this dispense. If you're dispensing the full amount for that fill, a label will automatically be generated and prompt you to print. If you are dispensing from two lots into separate containers, you'll need to scroll down and print a label from the dispense list for each container. If you're dispensing from two lots into the same container, you'll need to print a label from the **Print Label** button at the top of the screen.
