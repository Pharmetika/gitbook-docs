# Capturing Product Images During Dispensing

Pharmacies can capture an image of the final product and/or quantity for each prescription dispensed. This feature assists with quality control and the image remains available for viewing in the event of a patient complaint. The **Take Photo** button appears after the product lot label is scanned. This feature is compatible with any camera, whether it's on a desktop, laptop, iPad, or other device.

After capturing the image, the image is attached to the dispense and saved in the **Documents** section on the left, and can be easily accessed in the **Dispense Queue** when needed.
