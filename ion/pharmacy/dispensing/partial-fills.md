# Partial Fills

To dispense and mail out a partial fill, you should first record the partial fill in your dispensing queue.

You should then set the "Date Ready By" to a future date (when you expect to finish dispensing).

Go to the patient's summary and locate the **Shipments** heading.

Here you can select a handoff method and click **Create** to make a shipping label for your partial fill.

Once you're ready to dispense the rest of the fill, you can dispense and finish the fill as usual. Make sure to verify it and create a shipment from the **Prescription Hand-Off** activity.
