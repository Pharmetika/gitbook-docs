# Allowing Camera Access

If you are unable to access your camera, please try the following troubleshooting steps:

* Ensure the camera is not already in use by another tab or application. If another tab or application is using the camera, it may prevent you from being able to access it in ion.

If the first step does not work, go to Start > Settings > Privacy > Camera, then:

1. Enable the **Allow Access to the Camera on This Device** option. For this, click **Change** and switch the slider to the **On** position.
2. Set **Allow Apps to Access Your Camera** by switching the corresponding slider to the **On** position.
3. Restart your browser.
