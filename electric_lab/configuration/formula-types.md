# Formula Types

Allows you to create templated instructions and tasks (e.g., if all topical ointments are compounded using the same instructions and tasks, creating a “topical ointment” formula type allows you to import the formula type instructions and tasks to any formula labeled a “topical ointment” on its master formula record).

Enter the template name, station type and compounding instructions. &#x20;

Add tasks by clicking the **+** symbol.
