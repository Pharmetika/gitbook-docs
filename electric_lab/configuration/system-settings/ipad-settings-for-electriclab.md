* **Display & Brightness Settings:** Consider increasing the Auto-Lock time to 15 minutes so the iPad doesnâ€™t turn off in the middle of a task.

* **Handoff Settings:** Disable Handoff.
* **Software Update Settings:** Either manual or automatic update. Discuss which option might work best for your facility.
