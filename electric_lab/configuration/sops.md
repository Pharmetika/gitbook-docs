# SOPs

There are two sections for SOP assisting with general flow and sequence of activities required to achieve specific organizational goals, those being **Manage SOPs** and **SOP Task Queue**.

## Manage SOPs

A list of created SOPs will display here. Users can add or modify existing SOPs and manage tasks. Completed tasks and SOP revisions will also display here.
