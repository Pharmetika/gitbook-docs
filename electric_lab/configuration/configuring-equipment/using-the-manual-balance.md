# Using the Manual Balance

Rarely, you might encounter a situation in which your scales can't connect to the system. For example, you might encounter technical problems with transmitters or with the scales themselves. In these instances, you can weight your ingredients separately and then enter the those weights using the manual balance option.

To use the manual balance:

1. Follow the path **Configuration** > **Configure Equipment.** In the equipment list, find the **Equipment: Balance-Manual** entry.
