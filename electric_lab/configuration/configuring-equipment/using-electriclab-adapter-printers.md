4. Ensure the printer is plugged into the ElecticLab adapter, and the adapter is turned on and lit up.
5. Print the label for the printer and attach it somewhere you can easily scan it later.

## Using The Printer

First, scan the printer label to associate the printer with your device. A printer icon appears in the top left to indicate you have the printer checked out.

You can now print to this printer. Labels are printed normally. An additional option appears for printing unit dose labels from the connected printer.

If the printer is offline, or fails to print, the label opens in a PDF in a new tab, as it would normally without a printer checked out,

## Disconnecting from a Printer

* A connected printer stays connected across new tabs, page refreshes, and device reboots.
* You can disconnect from your currently checked-out printer by selecting **Disconnect Printer** in the top-right dropdown menu.
