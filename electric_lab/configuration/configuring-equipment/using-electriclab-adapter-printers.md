## Setting Up New Printers

* Add a new piece of equipment from the **Equipment Configuratio**n screen.

* Change the equipment type to **Printer**, configure it to match the printer you have, and set the transmitter ID.

* Ensure the printer is plugged into the EL adapter, and the EL adapter is turned on and is lit up.
* Print the label for the printer, and attach it somewhere you can easily scan it later.

## Using The Printer

* Scan the printer label to associate the printer with your device. You should see a printer icon in the top left to indicate you have the printer checked out.

* You should now be able to print to this printer. Labels will be printed normally; you will see an additional option for printing unit dose labels from the connected printer.

* If the printer is offline, or fails to print, the label will open in a PDF in a new tab (as it would normally without a printer checked out).

## Disconnecting From a Printer

* A connected printer will stay connected across new tabs, page refreshes, and device reboots.
* You can disconnect from your currently checked-out printer by selecting **Disconnect Printer** in the top-right dropdown menu.
