# Add Inventory

Scan the 1D barcode (UPC) from the manufacturer container in the search field. You can also search by typing in the box. The ingredient entry must be created prior to this step (See Manage Ingredients).

Enter all inventory fields:

* **Lot #:** directly from the container; different Lot numbers will require a separate entry.
* **BUD:** directly from the container; may be labeled “expiration date.”
* **CoA adjustment:** add if desired; this field will not affect calculations such as activity factor (See Manage Ingredients → Ingredient Options).
* **Quantity / # of Containers:** the total quantity (e.g., if you order Acyclovir Lot 12532 and receive 5 containers of 100 gm, the quantity is 500 gm and 5 containers; If you do receive multiple containers, click the “labels” button and enter the quantity for each container. &#x20;
* **Capsule weight:** If you are entering capsules, obtain the empty capsule weight and enter in this field. The empty capsule weight will display during the compounding process. &#x20;
* **Documents:** Any additional documents should be added during this process.

After entering the ingredient information, select the 'Review' status from the drop-down and click **Save**. This will generate an **Inventory Receipt Review** Task that the pharmacist will review from the task queue (**Task Queue > Inventory Receipt Review**).
