## New Ingredient

* **Ingredient Description**: Verify the name of the ingredient including spelling.
  * **Note:** Code is a required field; this is frequently used as a short code, such as “E2” for Estradiol.
* **Units**: Select the units from the dropdown menu. This will frequently be grams, mL, each, or capsules. The units must remain consistent throughout the system. If you enter olive oil in mL, do not enter units of Liters in another place. The scales weigh grams, so kg would not be appropriate as the unit of measure.
* **Primary NDC:** The primary NDC should be the NDC you have in stock or the one you use most frequently. This information is pushed into the dispensing system (ION) and is used to determine the schedule of the ingredient, so this should be an accurate NDC. If there is no NDC and you want the ingredient sent to the dispense system, i.e. for pricing the compound, enter a unique numeric identifier of 11 digits or less. If you do not need the ingredient in the dispense system, i.e. won’t use it for billing, leave the primary NDC blank.
* **Cost Basis:** Should contain the acquisition cost in a per unit format. (Use the unit selected from the dropdown menu, per gram, per mL, etc)

Ingredient Options:

* **Hazardous:** As defined by USP <800>, hazardous drugs. For more info, See below.

* **Active:** Active pharmaceutical Ingredient (do not check for excipients, bases, etc.).
* **Consumable:** An ingredient used in the compounding process that is to be tracked, but its expiration date is not used in determining the BUD of the finished preparation.
  * **Example:** sterile tubing.
* **Has Activity Factor**: Ingredients with “activity” that can vary from lot to lot.
* **Has pack stat:** Ingredients with pack stats. See Pack Stat Module.
