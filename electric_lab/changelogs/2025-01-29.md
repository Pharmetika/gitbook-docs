## Enhancements

* Ingredients marked as “consumables” will now appear at the bottom of the ingredient list on the formula-level, within the “Create Lot” task, and on the worksheet.
* Added a “Fixed Quantity” checkbox for ingredients designated as consumables at the formula-level. Lab users can select this option and enter a fixed quantity, ensuring the quantity remains unchanged within the formula.
