* Fixed an issue where unit dose labels with ingredient amounts with a value less than 0.01 units rounded down to zero. Now, these labels round to the nearest thousandth and weights less than 0.01 grams appear in milligrams, which makes the label more accurate for compounds with very small amounts of some ingredients. For example, prior to this change, a value of 0.0025 grams appeared as 0 grams on unit dose labels. With this change, a value of 0.0025 grams appears as 2.5 milligrams.
