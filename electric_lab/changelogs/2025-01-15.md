## New Feature

* A new Save Lot action button has been added for the Create Lot task page in Electric Lab, allowing compounders to save progress without scrolling to the top of the page. Scanning the Save Lot barcode saves all information on the screen, enabling compounders to leave and return with all data intact. For more details about this feature, click [here](../configuration/action-barcodes.md).

## Enhancement

* The new unit dose label design is now available for all sizes. When selecting a template size from the drop-down list, the label will display as a static example, providing a clear preview of the design before printing. Note that this is a static representation, not a live preview. For more details, click [here](../formulas/configuring-unit-dose-labels.md).&#x20;
