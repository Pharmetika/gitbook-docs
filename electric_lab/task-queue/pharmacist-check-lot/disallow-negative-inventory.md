# Disallow Negative Inventory

## Overview

When a **Create Lot** task is submitted for pharmacist review, pharmacists may be prompted to address negative inventory issues if the scanned ingredient lot shows a negative balance. In such cases, pharmacists should first verify whether the negative inventory is accurate or if there is actual inventory present before making any adjustments.

Technicians don't have access to this information during the compounding process. The pharmacist sees this information at review as a prevention from impeding the compounding process.

## Ingredient Used with Negative Inventory

Once a batch has been submitted for review, the ingredient lot and recorded weight for the negative inventory appear in <mark style="color:red;">red</mark>.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to approve the lot, the negative inventory shown above in <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> must be resolved _prior_ to approving the batch lot.
{% endhint %}

## Adjusting Negative Inventory

To adjust the negative inventory, click the pencil icon shown below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Investigate inventory to verify if negative inventory is accurate or if there is actual inventory on hand. Once negative inventory is verified, the pharmacist reviewing can either send the batch back for rework or scrap the batch.
{% endhint %}

Enter the number amount for adjustment, then click **Submit**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The amount to _add_ inventory must be entered with a negative (**-**) sign in front of the number. For example, if the inventory overcommitted is -1, a user enters -2 to put the inventory at 1.] The added amount should result in enough inventory to cause the <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> font to disappear.
