# Summary

The task queue helps manage the lab workflow by showing tasks that need to be completed. Tasks are sorted by due date and time and priority type by default, but can also be sorted by additional filters. Select and unselect task types from the dropdown menu that are pertinent to each lab user. For example, a compounding technician might want to see only Create Lot and Lot Rework tasks.
