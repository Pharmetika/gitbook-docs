# Lot Creation FAQs

**Q: How is the Beyond Use Date (BUD) assigned?**

**A:** The BUD is assigned from the date compounding starts, not the date the task is created. If an ingredient is scanned that has a shorter BUD, the date is automatically adjusted.

**Q: Can more than one balance be used at the same time?**

**A:** Yes. Wireless design of ElectricLab allows the compounder to freely move throughout the lab without needing to log out when switching between equipment and workstations.

**Q: Can more than one lot of the same ingredient be used for the same compound?**

**A:** Yes. Scan the first lot and capture the weight,  then scan the second lot and continue weighing. All lots and weights used for the same ingredient are tracked to the right of the ingredient name.
