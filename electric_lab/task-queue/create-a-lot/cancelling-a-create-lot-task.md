# Cancelling a Create Lot Task

If the pharmacy wishes to _exclude_ a lot task from being recorded in the master formula's inventory history and from appearing on the scrapped lots report, users can click **Cancel** at the top right corner to cancel the lot task.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
This cancellation does **not** decrement inventory.
{% endhint %}
