# Scrapping Lots

## Overview

Scrapping lots enables the pharmacy to dispose of a batch lot that is in the compounding process. This might be necessary if a batch was compounded incorrectly or did not pass the pharmacist's review and needs to be disposed of.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Scrapped lots are recorded in the master formula's inventory history section and on the scrapped lots report.
{% endhint %}

There are two options to scrap a lot task:&#x20;

1. If a lot task has _not_ begun, users can click the **Cancel Task** button to have the lot scrapped and recorded.

2. If a lot task is in _progress_ with or without ingredients weighed out, users can click the **Scrap Lot** button to have the lot scrapped and recorded.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Scrapped lots **with** ingredients weighed out decrement from inventory.
{% endhint %}

If the pharmacy wishes to _exclude_ a lot task from being recorded in the master formula's inventory history and from appearing on the scrapped lots report, refer to [Cancelling a Create Lot Task](cancelling-a-create-lot-task.md).
