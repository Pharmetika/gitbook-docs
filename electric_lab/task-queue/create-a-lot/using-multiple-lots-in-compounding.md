3. After the weight is captured, zero the scale and record the zero weight. You can record the zero by either scanning the 2D barcode on the ingredient or by clicking the <mark style="color:blue;">blue</mark> arrow icon across from the ingredient name.

5. Weigh the desired amount and record the weight. In the example below, there are 15.5 grams weighed out of 15.75 grams desired. Lot 157889/B = 6.4 grams and Lot 159005/P = 9.1 grams.
6. Zero the scale before continuing.
