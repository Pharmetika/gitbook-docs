# Adding Attachments

## Overview

Adding attachments to a compounding lot is important to enhance record-keeping. This functionality allows pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to document essential information related to each batch, such as volumetric images of liquid ingredients or pertinent documents, ensuring compliance. Users can upload a photo or document or record a video using an iPad or webcam on a desktop.&#x20;

## Adding an attachment to a lot/batch at the ingredient level

In a **Create Lot** task, manually enter the weight in the Manual Entry field under the Balance-Manual heading instead of recording it from a scale. After the weight is entered, you can upload or take a photo of the measurement, whether it is a volumetric or scale image.

To retake an image, users can archive an image by clicking the circle ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-08-09 at 4.11.24â€¯PM.png>) button. Archived images appear with a red strike through the middle of the image icon and are still accessible.&#x20;

## Adding an attachment to a lot/batch at the task level

In the **Create Lot** task, locate the **Instructions** section, where you can choose to upload a document or take a photo and attach it to a specific task.

To add an attachment at the task-level, select a task and choose **Upload** or **Take Photo**.&#x20;
