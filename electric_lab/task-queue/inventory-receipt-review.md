# Inventory Receipt Review

After an ingredient inventory has been added, the system generates an **Inventory Review** task. After reviewing the data entry for accuracy and making any desired changes, select the appropriate status from the dropdown menu and click **Save**. Print the labels for any accepted inventory and affix the labels to the ingredient containers. RPh should initial the labels.
