# Requesting Technical or Educational Support

Technical and education support is available during the hours of 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM Central Time, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

You can request support for either of the following reasons:

* If a feature is not working as expected or there is a seemingly technical issue with the system, you can request technical support.&#x20;
* If you have a how-to question or enhancement request, you can request educational support.

## When to Request Support

Request technical support immediately after you experience an issue, and submit the request on the computer that experienced the issue and from the user who was logged into the session when the issue occurred. When you request support, it’s important to include sufficient details so the technical support team can easily understand the issue. Doing so will expedite assigning the support request to the appropriate team member for investigation and resolution.

Important notes: &#x20;

1. The technical team cannot troubleshoot requests that are submitted by a different user, from a different computer or session, or not immediately after the issue has been experienced. _Users will be asked to recreate the issue and submit a new request._
2. Ensure that ad blockers are disabled so the technical team is able to view the necessary information to assist you.
3. Providing additional context allows the technical support team to triage quickly and assign to the appropriate team member.

If you select **Help with the system** for general guidance or how-to questions, you’ll be contacted by a member of our education team. If you select **Technical issue** to report an issue you’re experiencing, you’ll be contacted by a member of our technical support team.
