# Formula Tasks and QA Tasks

{% hint style="info" %}
The tasks referred to this section are formula tasks and formula type tasks, which are different from the tasks pharmacists and technicians review and complete in the Task Queue. The tasks discussed here appear only during compounding and quarantine and don’t appear in the Task Queue.
{% endhint %}

Formula tasks are checkpoints that remind technicians and pharmacists to complete certain actions or record certain data during compounding.

Tasks can use any of the following settings:

* **Record Weight\[s]**. When this setting is enabled, the technician or pharmacist can record a weight from the scale using the task. The weight can only be recorded if the scale is first scanned into the system.

* **Record Other Measurements.** When this setting is enabled, the technician or pharmacist can record a free-text measurement using the task.

* **Record Time.** When this setting is enabled, the technician or pharmacist can record the time and date using the task.

* **Include Photo.** When this setting is enabled, the technician or pharmacist can attach a photo using the task.

* **Required.** When this setting is enabled, a red alert icon appears for the incomplete task, and the compound can’t be sent for verification or quarantine unless this task is marked as completed.

* **Pharmacist Only.** When this setting is enabled, only users with a role of Pharmacist can mark this task as completed. Other users see the task as read-only.

Below the **Tasks** section is the **QA Tasks** section. QA tasks work similarly to other tasks, except that they can be completed or marked as incomplete during quarantine, while other tasks become read-only after a medication is quarantined.

You can either set tasks manually for a specific formula, or set tasks for all formulas created from that type at the formula type level.
