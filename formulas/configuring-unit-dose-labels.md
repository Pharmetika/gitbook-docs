# Configuring Unit-Dose Labels

Unit dose labels are utilized for formula products that are pre-packaged and sealed in a secure container and distributed as either a single or multi-dose medication.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A single or multi-dose medication is usually individually packaged. For example, testosterone cypionate 200mg/ml is typically packaged in 10ml vials.
{% endhint %}

To enable unit dose labels for specific formulas, navigate to the section called **Unit Dose Label Options** on the formula's master formula record page. The unit dose labels can be customized utilizing the fields and options as seen below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unit dose labels and patient prescription labels autosize the information you enter in these fields so that it fits in the available space. If you use a product description, label decription, or formula name in the format drug1/drug2/drug3, the autosize functionality might split the description at a suboptimal place, making the label more difficult to read. To avoid this issue, we recommend adding spaces before and after each slash, so that the format appears like this: drug1 / drug2 / drug3.
