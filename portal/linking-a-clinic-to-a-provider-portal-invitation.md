# Linking a Clinic to a Provider Portal Invitation

The pharmacy has the ability to select a clinic to be linked to a provider portal invitation. Upon accepting the invitation, the provider will see the name of the linked clinic near the bottom of the page. Providers can now create their accounts simply by setting a password at the invitation step, skipping the clinic creation step. For clinics with multiple providers, this process reduces the risk of duplicate clinics due to slight address variations.

## Create a New Clinic

To add a new clinic, find Clinic List under the Portal section. Click the **+ New Clinic** button in the top right corner of the list. A new clinic screen will appear to fill out the necessary information, only the name of the clinic is required, and click **Save**.

**NOTE:** To invite providers to the portal, a clinic must be created even if they are already associated with an organization.

Click on [Clinic List Guide](clinic-list/) for more details on managing clinics.

Once the invitation is opened, providers will see a screen with all the necessary information pre-filled. Near the bottom of the screen, the name of the linked clinic will appear. Providers may need to select 'Is Veterinarian' and 'Has Collaborating Provider,' but they must create their password for the portal.
