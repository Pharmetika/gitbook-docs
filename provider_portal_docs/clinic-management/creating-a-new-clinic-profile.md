# Creating a New Clinic Profile

Creating new clinics allows larger medical groups to organize their patients and staff by locations. Create new clinics with the **New Clinic** button to the top right of the Clinic list.

* **Example:** Skin Care Solutions just opened a downtown location so a new clinic was created. Staff that work at this location can be created or if staff work at multiple locations, and already have an account, they can be invited to this new clinic.
