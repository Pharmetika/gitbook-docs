1. To change the patient demographics, click **Edit**.
   1. Update the patient's name, date of birth, phone number, and shipping address if needed.
2. The **Recent Activity** tab shows all recently prescribed medications.
   1. **Note:** Only prescriptions verified by a pharmacist will appear in the **RX History** tab with a prescription number. Prescriptions that have been recently sent but not yet processed by the pharmacy will not be visible in the RX History tab. These prescriptions can be seen on the **Recent Activity** tab.
3. Clicking on **Go to RxPad** will take you to the Rx Pad, where you can prescribe medications. If you access the Rx Pad through the patient's profile, the patient will already be selected.
   1. **Note:** If you navigate to the Rx Pad from the left menu, you will need to select the patient before prescribing.
4. Active status means that the prescription can be filled. The prescription has not expired and has active refills.
5. The Last Filled date refers to the most recent date the prescription was filled by the pharmacy. Please note that this does not indicate the date the fill was processed or shipped.
   1. When a prescription is filled in the pharmacy, it means that the prescription information has been sent to the dispensing queue for the product to be dispensed.﻿
6. The **Date Due** is the refill due date for the patient's prescription. It is determined by the Last Filled Date and the Day Supply of the previous fill.
   1. Prescriptions that have not been filled yet will have an **N/A** Date Due until the prescription is filled for the first time.﻿
7. The status **Unfilled** indicates that the prescription has not been filled yet. It is currently held on the patient's profile. This prescription can still be filled if it is an active prescription.﻿
8. Inactive status indicates that the prescription is no longer valid for filling. This can occur if the prescription has been discontinued, expired, or has zero remaining refills.
   1. **Example:** If a prescription was last filled today and has zero refills, it will be marked as inactive. The prescription is being filled for the initial prescribed fill, but there are no refills remaining.
9. The color dot represents a pharmacy-created workflow that is associated with the prescription. These workflows assist the pharmacy in managing their queues and do not affect the prescriptions themselves.
10. Tracking numbers will be visible after the shipping carrier has scanned the shipped prescriptions. ﻿
