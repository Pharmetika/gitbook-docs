# Recent Order Status

Recent Order Status provides the clinic staff with visibility regarding the pharmacy status of submitted medication orders. Visibility is applicable only to the first and initial fill on newly submitted medication orders. Statuses are updated in real-time with timestamps.  The status history is available on the patient profile.



The statuses are visible in two different areas in the portal:&#x20;
