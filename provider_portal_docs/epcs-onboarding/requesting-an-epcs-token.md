# Requesting an EPCS Token

EPCS tokens are required for providers to electronically prescribe controlled substances.&#x20;

First, the pharmacy must enable the EPCS option for a specific prescriber in the Practitioner Portal. To do so, go to Portal > Practitioners and search for the prescriber in the **Practitioner List.** Then, enable the **Request EPCS** setting for the specific prescriber.

Next, the prescriber logs into the Provider Portal using their existing credentials and completes these steps:

1. Click on the three dots next to the username at the top right-hand side. Select **Request 2FA Token**. If you do not see this menu item, please contact your pharmacy to enable this menu option for your account.

2. The **Request EPCS Hardware Token** window appears. Enter the United States address the token should be shipped to, choose which type of USB token you need, and click **Submit**. We do not ship tokens to addresses outside of the United States. If you aren't sure which type of USB token to request, check the USB port on your desktop or laptop computer.

The token is shipped with a signature required. Please allow up to 10 business days after completing identity verification for the token to be delivered. Identity verification must be completed before the token can be shipped.
{% endhint %}

Once submitted, another window appears stating the terms and conditions for using EPCS. Please read them in their entirety, then click **Agree** at the bottom of the page to agree to the terms and conditions.

After you agree, a success message appears. An invitation email is then sent to your email address from Trust Swiftly. Follow the instructions in this email to complete identity verification.
