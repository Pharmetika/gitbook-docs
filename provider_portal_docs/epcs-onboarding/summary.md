# Summary

Electronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances (EPCS) is required for providers to prescribe controlled substances electronically.

If the prescriber does not have EPCS authorization, they receive a notification message when attempting to submit a controlled substance prescription. The controlled substance prescription cannot be submitted without an EPCS token.
