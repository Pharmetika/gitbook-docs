# Verifying a Secure Card

Once card details have been entered, a new page will appear disclaiming the verification process. Click **+Verify Card** to proceed.

* **Note:** As the image states, the small charge used for verification is temporary and automatically reversed after the verification process is complete.

Provider Portal will then charge the secure card with a random small amount. Once you find the value of the charge in your banking app of choice, type the value in to the pop up below and click **Confirm** to verify your secure card.
