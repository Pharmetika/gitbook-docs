# Verifying a Secure Card

1. From the Trust Swiftly verification page, click the **Verify Now** button.
2. After you submit credit card details, a new page appears that explains the verification process. Click **+Verify Card** to proceed.

{% hint style="info" %}
As part of this process, Trust Swiftly charges a small, random amount of money between 50 cents and two dollars to the credit card you entered. This small charge used for verification is temporary and is automatically reversed after the verification process is complete.
