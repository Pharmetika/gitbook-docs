# Linking a Portal Account

You can link a practitioner/clinic combination to a prescriber profile in the pharmacy system. This will link electronic prescriptions from that practitioner/clinic to the respective prescriber profile. This will also connect patients linked with the pharmacy's prescriber profile with the practitioner's portal account and give them visibility to prescription history.

When practitioner accounts are created, this link will already be established. If a practitioner creates a new clinic in their portal, upon receiving the first electronic prescription, a new prescriber profile will be created. However, there are times where you will still need to manually create this link.

* **Example:** Provider Joe Smith works at Happy Clinic West and starts practicing at another clinic that the pharmacy has an existing profile for, Southern Clinic of Joy. In order to leave the patients attached to Happy Clinic, the pharmacy should link the existing provider profile with the new portal/clinic account.

In the event the pharmacy has an existing profile for a practitioner/clinic, but it is _not_ already linked:

Select the Portal account and connected clinic as shown below. If a new prescriber profile was created, but your prefer to use the older existing one, you can disconnect the link on that profile and mark the profile as archived.

To link a portal account to a prescriber profile, you can search for and select the portal account for that provider.

You should only ever attach the portal account specifically made for that prescriber. Linking the incorrect practitioner/clinic combination could cause issues.

Once you've selected a portal account, you should select the clinic that is associated with that portal account at the location for this prescriber profile.

You can then save your changes to the prescriber by clicking the **Update** button in the bottom right.
