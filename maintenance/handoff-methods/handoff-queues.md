# Handoff Queues

Each Handoff Method is attached to a designated queue which has a specific barcode. After Rx verification by the pharmacist, the Rx will be scanned into a queue for handoff. A barcode will need to be generated for each queue.

* **Example:** If the Rx is being mailed, the system will ask you to scan the Mail/shipping barcode. If the Rx is being picked up at the pharmacy, the system will ask you to scan the Pick-Up barcode.
