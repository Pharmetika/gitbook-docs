# Remove Product/Organization from a Price Plan

When deleting a price plan with a product or organization attached to it, the system will block the deletion and prompt you to remove the attachment first. The attachment can be either a product or an organization or it can be both. Removing the specific attachment prevents the price plan from being inadvertently removed from multiple products and/or organizations.

It is important to delete a product or an organization **from** a price plan and not the other way around.
