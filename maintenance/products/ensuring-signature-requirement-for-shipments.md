# Ensuring Signature Requirement for Shipments

Requires Signature When Shipped has two key components:

1. **Product-Level Setting:** Selecting “Requires Signature When Shipped” on the product page ensures this requirement is enforced for that product during shipping.
2. **Shipment Screen Enforcement:** On the shipment screen, this option must also be selected to align with the product’s settings. If the option is not selected when creating the shipment, a hard stop will occur, accompanied by a red alert at the top of the screen. This alert informs the user that the product’s signature requirement and the shipment settings do not match.

Open Product Options on the Product page, select "Requires Signature When Shipped," and click **Save**.&#x20;

When there is a mismatch, to proceed, the user must select “Requires Signature” on the shipment screen to complete the shipment creation and print the label. This feature is particularly useful for maintaining accuracy, especially when shipping is handled by separate departments.
