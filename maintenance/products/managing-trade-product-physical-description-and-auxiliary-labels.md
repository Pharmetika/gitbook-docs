# Managing Trade Product Physical Description and Auxiliary Labels

The pharmacy has the option to manually set auxiliary labels, offering flexibility to add warnings or instructions based on specific needs. Additionally, the system allows pharmacies to enter physical descriptions of trade products from the drug database, this may be useful when the product profile is incomplete. This provides better control over product labeling, ensuring accurate and comprehensive information. These features are particularly useful for trade products like veterinary drugs, which may not appear in the drug database, allowing pharmacies to ensure complete profiles for these items.

The secondary use of this feature will be to modify or update the manufacturer’s information in the product profile, particularly if there have been changes or updates to the manufacturer’s details. This ensures that the product’s profile remains accurate and up to date, especially when there are changes to key information.

After the drug/product ION entry has been saved, this is how the information will display (see image below.)
