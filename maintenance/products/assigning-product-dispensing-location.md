# Assigning Product Dispensing Location

Pharmacies with multiple dispensing locations can now assign specific products to a designated area within the pharmacy for easier dispensing.

## Configuring custom product location

Open System Setting and find the Products section, enter the name of a dispensing location in the Product Location field and click the blue + sign to create a new product location.

The product location created in System Settings will appear in the Product page to select and assign to a specific product. Click Save at the bottom when complete.

Users can also manually enter a location as free text (e.g., sterile room #2) on the Product page in the 'Location' field. Simply type in the location and press Enter/Return to save it, and then click Save at the bottom of the page to update the Product settings.&#x20;

## Filtering products in the Dispensing Queue

In the dispensing queue, enable the 'Product Location' filter. Locate the 'Location' drop-down menu and select the desired location to view products for dispensing (see video for demonstration).&#x20;

For locations entered as free text on the Product page, they wonâ€™t appear in the drop-down menu, but users can manually search for them in that same 'Location' field (see video for demonstration).&#x20;
