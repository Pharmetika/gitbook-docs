# Integrating with Parata



{% hint style="info" %}
If your organization uses a Parata dispensing machine, Pharmetika now has Parata integration available. Please email [education@pharmetika.com](mailto:education@pharmetika.com) for more details.
{% endhint %}

If your organization integrates with Parata, an automated dispensing system, and you've workin g with Pharmetika to set up the integration, you can enable that integration for a specific product by completing the following steps:

1. Go to Maintenance > Product and search for an existing product. If you already know the product name, skip the search.
2. Open the Product Options section.
3. Select the Dispense from Paranta checkbox.&#x20;

When this checkbox is selected, the system sends data for the product to Parata, including a Pharmetika fill label that you can print from Parata.
