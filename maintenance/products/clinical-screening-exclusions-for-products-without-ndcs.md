# Clinical Screening Exclusions for Products Without NDCs

Pharmacies can exclude products and specific ingredients that do not have a valid NDC or cannot be retrieved from the drug compendia. These products will be omitted from clinical screening.

If a product or ingredient has multiple NDCs due to the pharmacy sourcing from different manufacturers, all relevant NDCs must be added or marked for exclusion from clinical screening.

This setting is ingredient-specific, meaning if one ingredient in a formula is marked for exclusion, the rest of the ingredients in the formula will still be screened. This feature is not limited to the formula level alone.

When this setting is enabled, the ingredients, formulas, or products without an NDC will be removed from the “DUR Report” list on the clinical screening pop-up. The system will not display a warning about “Packaged Drug was not found,” as the pharmacy is already aware and expects this exclusion.

## Marking a Product or Ingredient to be Excluded from Clinical Screening&#x20;

* After creating a product entry, locate the product using the **“Existing”** filter on the Product page. Then, navigate to the Product Options section, check the **“Exclude from Clinical Screening”** box, and save the changes.

* In the clinical screening pop-up after prescription data verification (PV1) or on the Fill screen, products or ingredients marked as **excluded from clinical screening** will not appear in **DUR Results**.
