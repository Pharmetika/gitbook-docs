## Improvements

* Enabled consultation notes to be added/edited after filling the prescription. This applies to prescriptions dispensed in specific states that require a patient consultation for every prescription fill. It is no longer required to be documented in Pharmetika at the time of filling. To document counseling notes after filling a prescription, open the fill history for the desired prescription line and click **Edit Fill**. To see which states this applies to, click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17oPdFhfaRkRWdu5dXmfhIGujWzPrZ8V1/view?usp=sharing).

* Added 'Include Non-Formulary Items in Acquisition Cost' setting. Marking this will allow non-NDC ingredients to be factored into the acquisition cost when activated. This setting is under **Utilities > System Configuration > System Settings > Product.**
* Ability to disable payment functionality for patient-clinic profile marked ‘Is clinic/company’. To enable this setting, go to **Utilities > System Configuration > System Settings > Payments > Disable payment functionality for clinic/company patient profiles**.

* Added the ability to modify the product for prescriptions that have been entered but not filled, provided the drugs belong to the same category. For instance, you can switch between drugs within the same DEA schedule, among non-controlled substances, or over-the-counter medications. However, interchanging categories is not permitted at this prescription stage. To change the product, open on the prescription line and click **Edit Entry.** Only Pharmacists are permitted to make this change.
  * For example, this prescription is for non-controlled substances. When searching for testosterone, a controlled substance, to replace DHEA/Pregnenolone capsules, no results appeared and the drop-down menu did not expand.
