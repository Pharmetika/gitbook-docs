## New Features

*   You can now automatically add shipping charges for items shipped without using an order. You can configure this option for shipments billed to patients, shipments billed to organizations, or both.

## Enhancements

### Accounting Enhancements

* The new Payment Transactions- Organization and Payment Transactions - Patient reports show you transactions within a specific time period for a specific patient or organization. These reports can help you drill down into a specific organization or patient’s payments for accounting and reconciliation. You can access them from the Reports page or using the Payment Tx Report button on a patient’s or organization’s payment page.

* We’ve added the following columns to the Transaction Itemized Report to make it more complete and easier to use:
  * Patient Last Name
  * Patient First Name
  * Organization Name
  * Date of Birth (DOB)
  * Payment Source. If the payment source is a credit or debit card, the last four digits of that card appear in this column.
*   We’ve redesigned invoice PDFs to include more information about each item that can help your accounting team reconcile invoices more easily. This includes the order ID, tracking ID, and shipment ID, which can help accounting staff determine which orders and shipments each item was included in, the prescription transaction ID and charge ID to help them understand what was billed for in each invoice, and the fill number to help them differentiate between multiple fills of the same product. With this redesign, larger files also load more quickly and efficiently.

*   To quickly generate a PDF of all outstanding invoices, select the Group by Payer checkbox and then click the Print Invoice List button in the expanded invoice section on the Invoice Management page. To quickly generate a statement for a certain time period, click the Statement for Billing button. This button appears both on the patient and organization billing pages at the bottom of the Invoices section and in the expanded invoice section on the Invoice Management page.

### Administration Enhancements

*   The new Comprehensive Pharmacy Activity report shows prescription entry data, fill data, and dispense data in one place. This report lets pharmacies see all activity in the system in a single report. We’re actively soliciting your feedback on this report, so if you have comments or suggestions, you can email them here.

* With the new Price Plan Utilization report, you can see a list of all the available price plans in your system with information about how many products and organizations use each plan. We’ve also added a description of each price plan to the existing Organization Price Plan List report.

### Product Enhancements

*   On the Product page in ION, a setting can be enabled to prevent modifications to the product description from being overwritten by changes on the Formula page in ElectricLab. Without this setting, formula name changes in ElectricLab flow into ION, so that changes in ElectricLab also change the product description in ION. For more details, click [here](../maintenance/products/maintaining-product-description-when-updating-formula.md).

* Pharmacies can now exclude products and ingredients without a valid NDC or that are unavailable in the drug compendia from clinical screening. This exclusion removes items from the DUR Report list and prevents warnings about missing packaged drugs. Click [here](../maintenance/products/clinical-screening-exclusions-for-products-without-ndcs.md) for more details.

### Prescription Workflow Enhancements

* You can now transfer prescriptions into your pharmacy from an external pharmacy. To do so, create a new prescription, select Transfer in the Origin field, and click Transfer-in Details to open a window where you can record information about the transferring pharmacy.
