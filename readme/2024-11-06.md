## New Features

* Pharmacies can now add products to a state-specific exclusion list to comply with restrictions on certain medications, including out-of-state shipping limits. The feature supports NDC-specific exclusions by product, ingredient, strength, and manufacturer for full compliance. For more information, search for “Adding Products to a State-Specific Exclusion List.”

* Added a System Setting for pharmacies to set a default “Ready By” timeframe in hours. This feature auto-populates the “Ready By” date during prescription entry and fill page, based on the specified timeframe (e.g., 48 hours defaults to two days from the fill date).

* Added the ability to save an order to calculate shipping fees, including surcharges, without generating an invoice. Charges are added as unbilled items on the payment page for the designated bill-to party (patient or organization) and adjust automatically if items with surcharges are added, removed, or if the shipping method changes. For more information, search for “Adding Shipment Costs Without Generating an Order Invoice.”

* Added the ability for providers with multiple organizational associations to view all invoices within the portal. Regardless of their portal access point, they have visibility to all invoices across the clinics they are associated with. Go to **Invoices** tab on the left side panel in the portal and select the organization from the drop-down list.
* Added a **View Claims** link to the Fill History box for each fill to view pertinent fill and insurance claim information.
* Pharmacies can now transfer prescriptions to another realm or external pharmacy directly from the Prescription Data Verification page (PV1) for streamlined workflow. For more information, search for “Transferring Prescriptions on the Data Verification Page.”
* Added the ability to mark products as “Requires Cold Shipping” on the Product page and pair them with a cold-pack handoff method. If there’s a mismatch, the system generates a hard stop, requiring handoff method adjustment before completing the fill. For more information, search for “Managing Cold Shipping Requirements in Prescription Fulfillment.”
