## New Features

* A single product may need different price plans depending on the end user, dispensing container, or whether a kit is attached. Pharmacy staff can differentiate by duplicating the product in the Product page and adjusting as needed. Inventory in ElectricLab will deduct from the same stock for all duplicate entries. To ensure the correct product is selected during prescription entry and verification, check product description or NDC number for accuracy. Click [here](../maintenance/products/copying-a-formula-to-create-a-new-product.md) for more details.
* When the "Cold Pack Shipping" option is enabled on the Product page, an icon <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-09-24 at 5.39.35 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line"> will appear next to the product name on key pages during prescription processing, including the Prescription Entry, Prescription Fill, Dispense Queue, and Prescription Hand-off pages.

## Enhancements

* Prescribers with additional qualifications, such as controlled substance reporting (CSR), can be added by state under the "Addtl. Qualifications" field. To see a list of all prescribers in your system with this qualification, run the "Prescriber Addtl. Qualification List" report. Click [here](../maintenance/prescribers/entering-a-provider.md) fore more details.

* Some practitioners work under a Supervising Physician, depending on state requirements. If applicable, pharmacists can verify this by clicking the Supervisor link on the eRx at the prescription data verification step. This enhancement applies to external electronic prescriptions, excluding those from the Provider Portal.

* Manual DUR documentation at PV2 is optional. The pharmacy can choose to disable it, enable it only for veterinary patients, or have it always active for both human and veterinary patients. This flexibility allows pharmacies to tailor documentation settings to their specific operational needs, ensuring that Drug Utilization Review (DUR) requirements align with patient types and regulatory expectations. To enable these settings, go to Utilities > System Configurations > System Settings > Fills, select an option and click Save.
